1
00:00:03,162 --> 00:00:04,459
Wait!

2
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:07,563
St. Tail!

3
00:00:07,704 --> 00:00:09,638
I know your escape route!

4
00:00:18,257 --> 00:00:19,224
I did it!

5
00:00:25,804 --> 00:00:26,828
St. Tail.

6
00:00:28,242 --> 00:00:31,177
Today is the day
I'm going to capture you on film!

7
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,315
What...? Saruwatari!

8
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,446
Hey... What are you
smiling about?

9
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,313
Stop it!

10
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:03,029
What's with this article,
Saruwatari?!

11
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:04,399
What do you mean?

12
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:06,636
I just reported the facts.

13
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:09,678
You call these facts?!

14
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:11,308
First of all,
if you hadn't interfered...

15
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:12,980
...St. Tail would have been...!

16
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:15,750
Ah, she escaped
from you again, Asuka Jr.

17
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,420
What a pity...!

18
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:19,694
Shut up!

19
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:21,897
I'll definitely
catch her next time!

20
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:24,443
How many times
have we heard that before?

21
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:27,371
St. Tail may already be tired...

22
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,448
...of dealing with Asuka Jr.

23
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,618
What are you saying?!

24
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:34,889
You just don't
understand St. Tail!

25
00:01:35,132 --> 00:01:36,326
Don't talk like
such an authority.

26
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:38,198
That's right.
You're a loser.

27
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,406
Shut up!

28
00:01:39,507 --> 00:01:40,769
If you know so much...

29
00:01:40,943 --> 00:01:42,843
...why don't you
try to catch St. Tail?!

30
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,640
I'm glad you said that!

31
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,574
Asuka Jr. or the two of us...

32
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:49,788
Who can catch St. Tail first?

33
00:01:49,992 --> 00:01:51,118
Let's have a competition!

34
00:01:51,396 --> 00:01:52,693
That's what I want!

35
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:59,028
A BURST OF LAUGHTER!
THE DETECTIVE TEAM
DOES A GREAT JOB!

36
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,735
The Detective Team?

37
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:03,143
Yes! We've formed...

38
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:04,842
...the St. Paulia
Detective Team!

39
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:06,587
We're going to catch St. Tail...

40
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:10,319
...and hear Asuka Jr. say,
"I lost to you."

41
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:22,039
Wait... Wait a minute,
everyone...

42
00:02:23,187 --> 00:02:26,782
Both Kyoko and Ryoko
are highly motivated.

43
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:29,488
But you can never beat Asuka.

44
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,627
Right, Asuka?!

45
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:34,399
What are you doing?!
Get away from me!

46
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:38,036
Calm down, Meimi.

47
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:40,141
What's with Takamiya's attitude?

48
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:41,219
Hey, Kyoko!

49
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:43,382
Meimi! Seira!

50
00:02:44,326 --> 00:02:47,056
Let's join together
and catch St. Tail!

51
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,427
Because I'm serving God...

52
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:53,403
...I can't be
involved in a fight...

53
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,477
Seira...

54
00:02:55,112 --> 00:02:56,101
I'm sorry!

55
00:02:57,785 --> 00:03:00,219
All right then.
Kyoko! Meimi!

56
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,822
We three will do it!

57
00:03:11,944 --> 00:03:13,673
Emerald... you said?

58
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:17,974
My husband is the captain
of a ship going abroad.

59
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:19,648
The emerald was...

60
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,686
...my present to my husband...

61
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:24,997
...who would finish his last trip
and come back home.

62
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:27,997
It was stolen...

63
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,973
...by a jewel thief who has
been active recently...

64
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:32,874
...and targets big houses.

65
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:37,011
The police worked really hard.

66
00:03:37,124 --> 00:03:38,785
But they can't find any clues.

67
00:03:40,297 --> 00:03:41,855
Before my husband comes back...

68
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:45,331
...I want to get the emerald
back at any cost.

69
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:48,067
I want to see my husband's
look of surprise...

70
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,471
Your feelings...

71
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:52,072
I'm sure God
understands them...

72
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:57,054
According to my sources...

73
00:03:57,294 --> 00:03:59,888
...the thief is working
for a crooked businessman...

74
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:00,988
...Torabatake.

75
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:04,096
Torabatake destroys
all evidence...

76
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:05,504
...linked to the thefts.

77
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,177
He appears to be
hiding the jewels...

78
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,940
...in a bronze statue
of a dolphin.

79
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:11,917
A bronze statue of a dolphin?

80
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:15,088
You mean the one
at the All Sports Center...

81
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,284
...in the Port Area?

82
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:17,986
That Sports Center was...

83
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:20,858
...built by Torabatake
as a place to hide the evidence.

84
00:04:21,673 --> 00:04:24,073
I'm sure Mrs. Ono's emerald...

85
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:25,972
...is in the statue of the dolphin.

86
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:28,611
No one would ever suspect...

87
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:31,221
...that the stolen jewels
are hidden in there.

88
00:04:31,524 --> 00:04:32,491
I see.

89
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:34,583
It's your show time, Meimi.

90
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:36,591
With our power...

91
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,462
...let's get back Mrs. Ono's
important emerald!

92
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:40,873
Yeah.

93
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,310
All right!
I'm ready for anything!

94
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,242
We knew that
you'd come! Meimi!

95
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:03,314
What?

96
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,474
What do you mean, what?

97
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:06,985
You came to catch
St. Tail, didn't you?

98
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:08,825
Yeah...

99
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:11,824
In order to deliver
a warning note...

100
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,759
...St. Tail will have
to approach Asuka Jr.

101
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:17,305
We're going to catch her then!

102
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:19,673
What a brilliant plan we have!

103
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,747
Yeah, yeah.

104
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:22,650
What...?!

105
00:05:22,785 --> 00:05:23,843
What shall I do?!

106
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:25,819
Now I can't send
a warning note...!

107
00:05:40,384 --> 00:05:41,351
I'm sorry!

108
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:43,348
That boy is suspicious!

109
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,185
Kyoko! Meimi! Get him!

110
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:48,089
Wait... Wait a minute!

111
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:54,707
Are you all right, Asuka Jr.?

112
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:56,601
Ouch...

113
00:05:56,915 --> 00:05:59,247
What are you doing?!
Hey, you two!

114
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:06,560
Now we've caught you, St. Tail!

115
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,031
Let's see who you are!

116
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:11,369
Hey! Stop it!

117
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:14,677
Hey! Stop it!

118
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:15,748
Both of you!

119
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:18,748
We won't let you
interfere, Asuka Jr.!

120
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:22,319
We're going to catch St. Tail!

121
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:24,086
Speak up, St. Tail!

122
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:25,859
Admit that the ball
was a warning note!

123
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,501
Are you saying he is St. Tail?

124
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:33,302
No! I'm not St. Tail!

125
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:34,507
He's right!

126
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,777
That boy is not St. Tail. Here.

127
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,633
See?

128
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:45,828
She's right.
It's a regular ball.

129
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,405
That's strange.

130
00:06:51,448 --> 00:06:52,415
Bullies!

131
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:54,215
You brat!

132
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:55,815
Ah, ha!

133
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,319
What stupid detectives...

134
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:02,224
...thinking that child was St. Tail!

135
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:03,734
What did you say?!

136
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:14,423
"Tonight...

137
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:16,388
...at the All Sports Center...

138
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:19,986
...I'll take the bronze dolphin.
-St. Tail"

139
00:07:20,402 --> 00:07:21,869
What's this?!

140
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,637
She got through
our surveillance...

141
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,641
...and delivered
the warning note.

142
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,706
- St. Tail is very impressive.
- Yeah.

143
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:31,849
What surveillance?!

144
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,060
I don't want to hear anything
from a stupid detective...

145
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,894
...who didn't even notice
a warning note in his own pocket!

146
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,137
That's right!

147
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:41,863
What did you say...?!

148
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:45,707
This will be a problem...

149
00:07:57,404 --> 00:08:01,101
Meimi, how do you think
St. Tail comes in?

150
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:03,875
What?!
Why do you ask me?!

151
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,681
Your father is
a magician, isn't he?

152
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,445
So as a magician's daughter...

153
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:11,219
...I thought you might know
how St. Tail thinks.

154
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:15,154
You would think so,
but I don't know...

155
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:18,534
Are you okay losing
to Asuka Jr., Meimi?

156
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:23,047
St. Tail will probably
come this way...

157
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,782
We'll get you, St. Tail!

158
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:29,484
Watch us, Asuka Jr.!

159
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:32,623
I have to deal with their fight...

160
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,867
Please cover for me
while I'm gone, Ruby!

161
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,950
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

162
00:08:52,338 --> 00:08:53,305
One!

163
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:56,678
Two!

164
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,111
Three!

165
00:09:15,414 --> 00:09:17,041
Mrs. Ono's husband's ship...

166
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:18,775
...is arriving at the port
tonight, isn't it?

167
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:19,854
I have to hurry!

168
00:09:20,123 --> 00:09:21,647
Be careful, Meimi.

169
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:23,026
Don't worry.

170
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:25,354
I know what Asuka Jr. is up to.

171
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,829
No. The ones you have
to be careful about are...

172
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:29,165
...Ryoko and Kyoko.

173
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:32,204
We know those two well.

174
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:34,373
They may do
something unexpected.

175
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:36,745
No need to worry!

176
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:42,422
May the blessings
of God be with us.

177
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:45,390
Oh, hello.
May I speak with Meimi?

178
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:48,405
Oh, boy, that Meimi.

179
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:51,041
Of all times,
how can she be late now?

180
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:52,514
Meimi.

181
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:53,946
It's a phone call from Kyoko.

182
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:56,054
Meimi...?

183
00:09:57,391 --> 00:10:00,087
Meimi? Meimi!

184
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:09,178
Meimi?

185
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,438
Meimi!

186
00:10:15,592 --> 00:10:17,583
I've got a cold...

187
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,640
If she's sick,
she can't help us.

188
00:10:30,552 --> 00:10:34,886
All right then. It's just the two
of us. Let's catch St. Tail!

189
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:52,058
Mr. Torabatake.

190
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:56,731
You have arranged for your
company's security guards.

191
00:10:57,402 --> 00:10:59,233
I appreciate your cooperation.

192
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:01,834
It's the proper thing to do.

193
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:05,874
This bronze statue
is an important asset.

194
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:08,478
But...

195
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,853
...why is St. Tail
trying to steal this?

196
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,162
Even St. Tail...

197
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:21,535
...can't discover the secret
of this bronze dolphin.

198
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:22,614
Mr. President!

199
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,652
We've caught a suspicious man.

200
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:27,890
Hey! Come on!

201
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,226
Sawatari! Why are you here?

202
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:35,101
What do you think?!

203
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:37,536
I came to take pictures of St. Tail.

204
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:39,245
What?!

205
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:40,574
Do you know him?

206
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:41,649
Well...

207
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:43,452
Yes...

208
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:46,517
Ouch!

209
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:01,580
What's going on?!

210
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,892
This is...!

211
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,542
I won't let you escape,
St. Tail!

212
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,645
St. Paulia Academy
Detective Team!

213
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:20,812
Here we are!

214
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:25,292
You guys...!

215
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:26,799
Here we come!

216
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,686
What's this?!

217
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,960
Those are raw eggs,
Mr. President!

218
00:12:46,469 --> 00:12:49,302
Stop it!
This is St. Tail's magic.

219
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,678
Darn you guys!

220
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:55,785
What...?

221
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,261
The real St. Tail is over there!

222
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:11,607
Hey, hey! Wait, everyone!

223
00:13:23,371 --> 00:13:25,566
St. Tail! Don't move!

224
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:31,844
It's...

225
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:36,653
...Show...

226
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:38,221
...Time!

227
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,224
What?! What's that?!

228
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:09,485
Jewels! My jewels!

229
00:14:22,346 --> 00:14:23,438
Ouch...!

230
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:28,650
Is this an emerald?

231
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:39,134
Mr. Torabatake...!

232
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,110
You're Torabatake, aren't you?

233
00:14:43,318 --> 00:14:44,615
You're under arrest.

234
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:51,732
Dad!

235
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:53,699
Good job, Son!

236
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:58,707
Torabatake was
suspected of stealing jewels.

237
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:01,513
But we had a hard time
uncovering any evidence.

238
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:05,614
This incident finally gives us
the evidence we need.

239
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,624
My perfect hiding place...!

240
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:10,624
Darn you, St. Tail!

241
00:15:11,437 --> 00:15:12,426
Don't forget to cook
our dinner, okay?

242
00:15:12,873 --> 00:15:13,862
Yeah...

243
00:15:29,503 --> 00:15:31,027
St. Tail!

244
00:15:31,474 --> 00:15:32,463
I won't let her go!

245
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:35,908
Stop! St. Tail!

246
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:40,516
Lock on target! Fire!

247
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,092
Roger!

248
00:15:43,463 --> 00:15:45,658
Oh, no! The match is wet!

249
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:47,127
Good grief!

250
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,262
This is the escape route
I expected you to take!

251
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,488
No!
We're going to catch St. Tail!

252
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:03,954
Plan B!

253
00:16:10,245 --> 00:16:11,212
We did it!

254
00:16:11,815 --> 00:16:14,079
We've got you, St. Tail!

255
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,247
Now, show your face!

256
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,048
It's going to be my scoop photo!

257
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:19,726
Don't move!

258
00:16:31,017 --> 00:16:31,984
Watch out!

259
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,788
Fireworks...

260
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:42,162
I'm safe...

261
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:44,903
Oh, where is St. Tail?

262
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:47,634
Over there...!

263
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,580
No way!

264
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:53,452
Cheer up, you two!

265
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:54,547
But...!

266
00:16:54,694 --> 00:16:56,093
We prepared for so long...!

267
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,463
I'm always like that.

268
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:00,331
You did well, you two...

269
00:17:00,438 --> 00:17:02,770
...from the St. Paulia
Academy Detective Team!

270
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:05,470
Asuka Jr.

271
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:11,848
Thanks for a good photo!

272
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,238
Did St. Tail do this on purpose
in order to get us to make up?

273
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,643
But how would she
know about our fight?

274
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:26,584
That's right!

275
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:28,050
What's up, Kyoko?

276
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:30,051
We have to go
to Meimi to report this!

277
00:17:41,848 --> 00:17:44,112
I'm returning your
important emerald.

278
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:52,193
- So Meimi caught a cold?
- Is she all right?

279
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:54,859
Thank you for coming
all this way to see her.

280
00:17:54,972 --> 00:17:55,939
Please come in.

281
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,838
Meimi. Your medicine is here.

282
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:07,819
Thank you.
But I don't want it right now.

283
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,258
Don't be that way.
You've got to get better.

284
00:18:12,036 --> 00:18:13,298
Ryoko and the others
are here, too.

285
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:14,667
Open the door, Meimi.

286
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:18,646
Meimi. Answer me.

287
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:23,551
Oh, dear!
Something is wrong with Meimi!

288
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,651
Oh, dear! Hurry up!

289
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:28,663
You don't need to worry.
She must be sleeping.

290
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:42,383
What's the matter, Meimi?
You didn't answer.

291
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:43,857
Sorry! I must
have been sleeping.

292
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:45,224
See, I told you.

293
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,458
Oh, well...

294
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,093
I'm leaving your medicine here.

295
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:52,075
It seems like you're
dealing with the cold well.

296
00:18:52,177 --> 00:18:53,906
Yeah. Sorry to worry you.

297
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:56,646
No, we're the ones
who are sorry.

298
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,579
To tell you the truth,
we let St. Tail escape.

299
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:01,983
Is that so?
I'm sorry to hear that. But...

300
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:05,966
...you guys became
friends again, didn't you?

301
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:07,525
Kind of...

302
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:10,506
But if Asuka Jr. hadn't interfered...

303
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,969
What are you talking about?

304
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:15,840
You're the ones
who interfered with me!

305
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,615
How can you say that?!
