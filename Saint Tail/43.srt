1
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:17,889
I don't want anything...

2
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,233
...because you are my treasure...

3
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:26,307
...because your eyes
are my treasure...

4
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:35,720
THE FINAL BATTLE!
SAVE ASUKA JR.

5
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:38,799
What?! Sister?!

6
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,107
Asuka Jr. hasn't come home?

7
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:44,844
Is it true?!

8
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:47,186
He's been absent
for four days already!

9
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:48,591
Did he disappear?

10
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:49,825
Where did he go?!

11
00:00:50,136 --> 00:00:51,194
Calm down!

12
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:53,700
Right now, the police
are looking for him, too.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,674
Then he really is missing?

14
00:00:58,556 --> 00:01:01,457
Sister! How is Detective Asuka?
Asuka's father?!

15
00:01:01,763 --> 00:01:05,631
Asuka's father is on
a top-secret mission right now...

16
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:07,262
...and we can't contact him...

17
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,342
Anyway, calm down!

18
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,545
He'll be fine, everyone...

19
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:14,818
I ran for my life
from the monastery...

20
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:23,537
Asuka Jr. didn't come
to the place in my warning note.

21
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:27,648
At that time, he was already...

22
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,148
...missing...?!

23
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:35,161
Takamiya...

24
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,777
He probably
screwed up somewhere.

25
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,581
But still, Asuka is Asuka...

26
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,953
I'm sure he must be eating
when he needs to eat...

27
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:46,495
...and he must be sleeping
when he needs to sleep.

28
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:49,600
He'll pop up sooner or later.

29
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:52,740
Don't worry.

30
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:01,998
Thank you.

31
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,470
It's been four days since I was
locked in the top of this tower...

32
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:33,739
Why?

33
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,010
Why did you hide
the truth from me?

34
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:41,619
Were you enjoying teasing me?

35
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:45,321
What was I to you?!

36
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:49,801
What did you think of me?!

37
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:00,926
Really?

38
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:04,334
Asuka Jr. didn't show up
at the warning note's location...

39
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:06,570
Did he see the warning note?

40
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:07,740
I don't know.

41
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:08,852
But...

42
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:10,255
Maju said...

43
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:13,817
No matter how much you search,
the detective won't come here.

44
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:15,823
Meimi! Does this mean...

45
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,837
...Asuka Jr. was captured
by the mother and daughter?

46
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:21,974
They're punishing me...

47
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:24,749
...to get their revenge
on Mom and me.

48
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:26,350
It's not fair!

49
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:28,722
I'm getting him back.

50
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,822
What?

51
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:34,204
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

52
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:37,577
Getting him back?!
You mean Asuka Jr.?!

53
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:43,598
One!

54
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:47,039
Two!

55
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,042
Three!

56
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:04,568
Meimi!

57
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,914
If you do that...

58
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:11,155
...it's the same
as telling him your identity!

59
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:13,892
It means that you'll get caught!
Then you two will...!

60
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:16,704
I'm sorry, Seira.

61
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:20,278
I suppose I can't be
St. Tail anymore.

62
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,509
But...

63
00:04:24,694 --> 00:04:25,820
...he's an important
person to me.

64
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:30,870
Even though he may hate me,
or I may not be able to see him...

65
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,841
...I want him back!

66
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:38,652
It's no use trying
to stop you, is it?

67
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:42,226
Good luck...

68
00:04:42,703 --> 00:04:43,761
Seira...

69
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:45,996
I'll be praying for your safety.

70
00:04:58,472 --> 00:04:59,439
Ruby.

71
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:03,742
Please. This is
the only method I have.

72
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:10,763
Please deliver this.

73
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,782
Lord, until now...

74
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:23,789
...Meimi has never
stolen anything for herself.

75
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:29,736
But this time...
no, only this time...

76
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:31,902
...please protect
Meimi and Asuka Jr.

77
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:36,017
May the blessings of God
be with the two of them.

78
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,167
What's this?

79
00:05:57,406 --> 00:05:58,930
It has something.

80
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:03,808
St. Tail...?

81
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:06,858
She's coming here soon, Mom.

82
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,361
Things are going as we planned.

83
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:15,668
I hypnotized the police
and sent them away.

84
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:19,012
No one will come to this
monastery and disturb us, Mom.

85
00:06:19,558 --> 00:06:21,617
All right.
Everything is in order here.

86
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:27,268
Lucifer's daughter...

87
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:31,274
I want to see you suffering soon.

88
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,628
It's time to eat.

89
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:46,509
How long are you planning
to keep me locked up?

90
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:49,045
That's obvious!

91
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:51,187
Until Mom says so.

92
00:06:51,497 --> 00:06:52,862
Don't worry about that. Here...

93
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:54,536
This is for you, isn't it?

94
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:56,630
A warning note?

95
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:07,795
Welcome to my house, St. Tail.

96
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:12,772
Asuka Jr. is here, isn't he?
Let him go!

97
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:16,076
You're a foolish girl.

98
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:20,324
Did you think...

99
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,193
...I would simply hand him over?

100
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:38,197
What a pretty picture.

101
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:40,199
This is a hallucination.

102
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:42,133
But I can't breathe.

103
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,582
Asuka Jr.

104
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:17,754
I have to find him!

105
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:27,004
How long is this hallway?

106
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:34,729
Keep running...

107
00:08:35,502 --> 00:08:38,164
...until your heart bursts.

108
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:41,742
The end...

109
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:44,849
I can't find the end of the hallway!

110
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:49,355
Where is Asuka Jr.?

111
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,817
This thing delivered it.

112
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,449
She's a stupid thief.

113
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,120
She's deliberately come here
to be defeated by Mom.

114
00:09:05,672 --> 00:09:09,164
"Tonight I'm going to
the monastery to get Asuka Jr.

115
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,372
-St. Tail"

116
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:13,419
Asuka Jr.?!

117
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,307
Give him back!
Give him back... Give him back...

118
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:53,642
How are you feeling?

119
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:00,657
Give him back!

120
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:07,538
Why don't you come with me?

121
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:12,345
It's a waste for your talent
to be stuck in such a small town.

122
00:10:13,494 --> 00:10:16,952
That's how Maju joined me.

123
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:20,170
She isn't my real daughter.

124
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,309
Why don't you join us and grab
all of the treasure in the world?

125
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:28,688
You can get whatever you want.

126
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,154
Gold...

127
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,134
Jewels and art...

128
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:35,939
You can live in luxury.

129
00:10:37,349 --> 00:10:38,577
I don't want it.

130
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,425
What is she talking about?

131
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:47,230
What I want is...

132
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,264
Give him back!

133
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:52,041
My jewel is...

134
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:55,544
Give him back!

135
00:10:56,392 --> 00:11:00,123
So that boy is
your 100-carat diamond...

136
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,500
I guess you aren't very smart.

137
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,644
This is a hallucination.
It's not real.

138
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:26,587
Asuka Jr.!

139
00:11:28,432 --> 00:11:29,524
One!

140
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:31,096
Two!

141
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:33,063
Three!

142
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:38,116
This warning note...

143
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:39,856
When did it come?

144
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:42,556
Warning note?

145
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:45,601
Are you stupid?

146
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,036
That's a love letter, isn't it?

147
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:50,075
Boys are so dumb!

148
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:52,679
Love letter?

149
00:11:55,761 --> 00:11:57,729
The other notes until now...

150
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:01,996
All of them...

151
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:18,671
I want to get caught by you...

152
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:25,655
Don't play with me!

153
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,659
I am...

154
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,603
I am not a princess
locked up in a tower!

155
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,620
I won't stand by
without doing anything!

156
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:41,025
I'm going to get out of here!

157
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:43,492
Asuka Jr.! Where are you?!

158
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:09,721
Dear Lord...

159
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,266
Please protect them...

160
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,472
God...

161
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:19,477
...is telling me...!

162
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,459
Asuka Jr. is in that tower!

163
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:30,903
Butterfly powder is mixing
with my jade dust!

164
00:13:37,695 --> 00:13:40,095
Ow! It's so loud!

165
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:41,859
Now's the time! Grab the keys!

166
00:13:47,183 --> 00:13:48,673
No!

167
00:13:50,558 --> 00:13:51,525
No!

168
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:21,017
You idiot! There used to be
a bridge to the other tower!

169
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,219
But there's nothing there now!

170
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,400
Asuka Jr.!

171
00:14:28,445 --> 00:14:29,412
One!

172
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:31,584
Two!

173
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,382
Three!

174
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:52,189
Now's not the time to save others!

175
00:15:06,165 --> 00:15:07,427
My silk hat...!

176
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:10,407
I'm... sorry...

177
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:14,175
I'm sorry...

178
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:15,649
I'm sorry...

179
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,922
I'm sorry...

180
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:22,736
The truth is... I'm St. T...

181
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:31,015
God is...

182
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:33,953
...watching...

183
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:45,549
Surrender and go quietly.

184
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,708
I'm sorry I didn't notice.

185
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:09,733
Mom! Mom!

186
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:13,110
What about our revenge?!

187
00:17:13,557 --> 00:17:14,581
It's all right.

188
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:19,390
If only I had met someone
like him 20 years ago...

189
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:20,470
What?!

190
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,733
If I had someone...

191
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,241
...who loved me no matter what...

192
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:28,711
Now let's go to the next town
and make some money, Maju!

193
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:30,119
Yes, Mom!

194
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:34,393
From that day...

195
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:38,299
...St. Tail disappeared
from Seika City.

196
00:17:38,814 --> 00:17:41,339
After all, she had been caught.

197
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:43,790
And...

198
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,588
8 YEARS LATER

199
00:17:51,744 --> 00:17:53,177
Thank you very much.

200
00:17:53,716 --> 00:17:57,015
We were able to save
another lost sheep.

201
00:17:58,092 --> 00:17:59,286
We owe it all to you.

202
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:01,322
Asuka Jr.

203
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:04,862
Oh, I shouldn't call you
Junior anymore.

204
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:07,405
You're a full-fledged
private investigator now.

205
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:09,844
- But I'm not used to it yet.
- Hey, you!

206
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:13,948
Asuka! Don't steal work
from the police!

207
00:18:14,764 --> 00:18:17,255
He means to protect the peace
in Seika City, doesn't he?

208
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:19,299
Hey, let me get
the scoop next time!

209
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:21,500
Yes, that's right.

210
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:25,248
After all, St. Tail
protected this town.

211
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:27,454
St. Tail...

212
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,421
I wonder where she went...

213
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:30,498
Yeah...

214
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:35,734
She's in the chapel.

215
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:38,106
You parked illegally, didn't you?!

216
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,718
- What?
- Wait! Saruwatari!

217
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:46,624
Meimi!

218
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:55,787
The secret promise they had...

219
00:18:57,795 --> 00:18:59,763
...will become
an eternal promise one day.

220
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:04,466
Yes, that day isn't far off.

221
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:20,533
THE END
