1
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,917
Who's there?

2
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,663
No, you mustn't be holding that jewel!

3
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:41,670
Evil spirits are in it! The moon's
evil spirits are locked in that jewel!

4
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:44,005
The moon's evil spirits?

5
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:47,412
You've got to come up with
a better story than that.

6
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:50,886
It's true! If you hold it up
to the full moon...

7
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:53,221
...the evil spirits will
be resurrected.

8
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:58,195
Stop your babbling!
This moon's jewel belongs to me now.

9
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:14,159
STEAL THE JEWEL OF THE MOON!

10
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:25,453
-Meimi!
-Oh, Sawatari.

11
00:01:25,924 --> 00:01:29,087
Hi. Talk about great timing.

12
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,699
I'm on my way to cover a story.
Do you want to come with me?

13
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:39,901
Why should I go with you, when I'm
not even on the news-writing staff?

14
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:43,880
Because you understand
my intellectual reporting.

15
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:49,528
-I wouldn't say that, exactly.
-Anyway, we're wasting time!

16
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:53,794
Hey, wait a minute.
Sawatari, let go of me!

17
00:01:54,174 --> 00:01:58,736
That Sawatari! Where does he think
he's taking Meimi to?

18
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:10,995
May I help you?

19
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:17,075
I came because I wanted to pray,
but I don't know how to start.

20
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,886
My name's Mochida.
This is rather embarrassing.

21
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:26,060
I used to be a burglar.
I just got out of prison.

22
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,465
A burglar?

23
00:02:28,704 --> 00:02:33,505
Please don't get me wrong.
I'm trying to go straight now.

24
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:39,244
Only thing is, I have a problem.

25
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:42,716
Perhaps it would help
if you talked about it.

26
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,692
All the things
I stole were returned...

27
00:02:45,935 --> 00:02:52,067
...to their rightful owners
by the police while I was in prison.

28
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:57,380
All except one. A jewel which
contains the moon's evil spirits.

29
00:02:58,023 --> 00:02:59,615
The moon's evil spirits?

30
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,594
Right after I stole the jewel,
its owner died.

31
00:03:06,204 --> 00:03:12,165
He had no family,
and the jewel was forgotten about.

32
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:19,422
After that, it slipped past the police
and was sold several times.

33
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:25,532
I finally located the present owner
and asked him to return the jewel.

34
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:31,271
What did you intend to do with
the jewel when you got it back?

35
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:34,041
I want to return it
to its rightful owner.

36
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:37,951
I mean, I want to leave it
at his gravesite.

37
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:39,958
That's very honorable.

38
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:44,529
That's the only thing
I can do in atonement.

39
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:49,677
But the present owner turned me down.

40
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:54,615
I thought about stealing
the jewel back, but...

41
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:59,387
No, you mustn't steal, not after
you worked so hard to reform.

42
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:03,866
You're right.
Stealing it just wouldn't be right.

43
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:08,636
Why don't you pray again and this
time put your entire heart in it?

44
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:12,820
Yes, I'll do that.
Thank you for listening.

45
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:15,548
By the way, where is that jewel now?

46
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:20,760
It's called the Jewel of the Moon
and is on display at the Space Museum.

47
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:25,735
Oh, yes, I've heard it's supposed
to glow like the moon.

48
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:29,683
So this is the Jewel of the Moon.

49
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,786
It's beautiful!

50
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:38,625
There's a rumor that the evil spirits
of the moon are trapped in it.

51
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:40,668
That's just hearsay.

52
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:45,602
I wonder. Still, it is exciting
to think about it.

53
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:54,363
That's the space stage...

54
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,866
...made to simulate
the weightlessness in outer space.

55
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:03,535
That planet looks like the real thing!

56
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:08,918
That's a holograph,
a 3-D picture of the real thing.

57
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:12,286
Rats, I forgot to take pictures!

58
00:05:12,932 --> 00:05:17,733
Meimi, get closer to
the Jewel of the Moon. Hurry!

59
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:23,237
Yes, two beautiful objects.
This will make a nice shot.

60
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:28,549
Wait a minute, don't bother me.
I'm busy!

61
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:33,888
Like I said-- Asuka Jr.!

62
00:05:34,838 --> 00:05:37,807
Didn't you see that?

63
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:41,612
Never mind that. Why are you here?

64
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,340
Well, I...

65
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:49,325
I'll bet you followed us here because
you got jealous seeing us together.

66
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:52,227
Why would I be jealous
about a girl like her?

67
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,995
Well, excuse me!

68
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:58,608
All right then, why are you here?

69
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:03,282
I came here to see how
their security system is set up.

70
00:06:03,824 --> 00:06:05,655
The security system?

71
00:06:05,894 --> 00:06:07,725
Please, Mr. Urano!

72
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:12,962
Please, Mr. Urano. Give the Jewel
of the Moon back to me, please!

73
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,402
You must be out of your mind.

74
00:06:15,644 --> 00:06:18,943
I'd be a fool to give it
to a former thief like you.

75
00:06:19,284 --> 00:06:22,947
Why can't you understand?

76
00:06:23,191 --> 00:06:27,491
-Enough of this! Throw him out.
-Yes, sir.

77
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:32,602
Let me go!
Mr. Urano, listen to me!

78
00:06:33,878 --> 00:06:38,781
I went through the black market and
paid a lot of money to get that jewel.

79
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,989
I'm not letting that thief
get his hands on it.

80
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:45,059
I'm going to get rich
putting it on display.

81
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:47,528
The trouble with you is...

82
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:00,653
Are you all right, sir?

83
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:04,226
Thank you. I'm fine.

84
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:15,639
I see. So that's what his motive was.

85
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:20,113
The way things are, Mr. Mochida
will resort to stealing again.

86
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:23,888
Let's get that jewel back for him.

87
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:26,831
Yes, Seira, let's do it.

88
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:38,513
Boy, that Sawatari sure
has a big mouth.

89
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:40,251
What's this?

90
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:43,660
"I'm going to
the Space Museum tonight...

91
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:46,737
...to steal the Jewel of the Moon.
-St. Tail"

92
00:07:47,544 --> 00:07:50,570
What's going on? Rats!

93
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,655
I wish she'd give me
notice ahead of time.

94
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,076
Stupid Asuka Jr.
He's always interfering.

95
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:15,724
Hey, Asuka Jr., what's the big rush?

96
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:20,194
Get out of my way!
I can't be wasting time with you!

97
00:08:24,142 --> 00:08:26,007
It's from St. Tail!

98
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:30,013
This is the break I've been
waiting for! Asuka Jr., wait!

99
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:38,430
Sorry, Ruby. I have a job to do.
I'll see you later.

100
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,212
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

101
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:53,957
One!

102
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:57,567
Two!

103
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,866
Three!

104
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:20,770
Still, it does bother me to think
there's evil in that jewel.

105
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:25,482
Oh, Seira, that's nothing but hearsay.

106
00:09:25,953 --> 00:09:31,186
Yes, but you mustn't let your guard
down. Be careful, Meimi.

107
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:34,392
Don't worry. I'll handle it!

108
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,369
May the blessings of God be with us.

109
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,449
I don't need your services.

110
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:47,414
Please wait.

111
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:54,121
Even if you don't hire me, the mayor
has ordered me to arrest St. Tail.

112
00:09:56,909 --> 00:09:58,342
Follow me.

113
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:04,510
Wow, look at all the equipment!

114
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:10,460
With equipment like this, St. Tail is
no more than a mouse, don't you agree?

115
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:15,668
Mr. Urano, this equipment is
no match for St. Tail.

116
00:10:16,077 --> 00:10:19,774
Well, if you're going to insist,
do as you wish.

117
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:23,385
Just don't interfere with our work.

118
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:29,289
-Yes, I understand.
-Boy, what a grouch!

119
00:10:55,748 --> 00:10:59,684
It's been forced open, but by whom?

120
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:11,796
Boy, I'm getting old.
I'm already out of breath.

121
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:33,472
-What's wrong?
-I thought I saw a shadow on monitor A.

122
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:36,242
-You what?
-Is she here?

123
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:47,161
Why, that's Mr. Mochida!

124
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:53,413
I can't let him commit a crime.
I've got to do something!

125
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:04,060
-It must have been my imagination.
-Don't fall apart on me.

126
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,568
It's St. Tail.

127
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,580
Hey, wait up!

128
00:12:11,551 --> 00:12:17,285
Even the infamous St. Tail couldn't
steal the jewel from this museum.

129
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,213
Hey, wait up!

130
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:43,399
What is this?

131
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,847
Crap!

132
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:52,180
Rats! You're not
getting away, St. Tail!

133
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,204
Do it.

134
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:06,337
It's a high electrical current!

135
00:13:14,297 --> 00:13:16,231
Oh, no!

136
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:19,033
Here goes.

137
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:25,672
Come back here, St. Tail!

138
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:38,003
Snap out of it, Mr. Mochida.

139
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:44,575
Mr. Urano, using high voltage
is very dangerous!

140
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:50,389
I will use every means available
to protect my priceless display.

141
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:55,924
You didn't tell us you hid the jewel
and were displaying a holograph!

142
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:57,400
That's dirty!

143
00:13:57,642 --> 00:14:01,578
I'm not so stupid that I'd let
someone steal my jewel so easily.

144
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:04,410
It sent St. Tail--
I mean, Holy Tail...

145
00:14:04,654 --> 00:14:08,647
...scampering away with her tail
between her legs. How fitting.

146
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:20,173
Damn that Urano.
He hid the Jewel of the Moon.

147
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:25,115
Mr. Mochida, I promise I'll get
the Jewel of the Moon back for you.

148
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:37,733
I can't do my job unless
you tell me where the real jewel is!

149
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:44,284
Your services are not needed. We can
take care of St. Tail ourselves.

150
00:14:44,526 --> 00:14:50,988
Let's go. St. Tail took quite a blow.
I don't think she'll be back tonight.

151
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:56,369
No, I'm sure she'll return.
It's in her nature.

152
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:02,076
That's strange.
Monitor F has stopped.

153
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:08,555
What's going on?
The hologram system's being activated.

154
00:15:09,037 --> 00:15:12,564
All the monitors are showing
the hologram system.

155
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,506
What's going on?

156
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,237
No!

157
00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:22,019
I've got it.
I know where the jewel's hidden!

158
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,524
What'd you say?

159
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:39,286
Mr. Urano,
that moon is the jewel, isn't it?

160
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:46,691
Oh, I get it. He hid it
inside the holograph image!

161
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:50,701
Good evening!

162
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,406
St. Tail, I'll get you
for sure tonight!

163
00:15:55,988 --> 00:16:00,687
It's Show Time!

164
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:08,498
I'm inviting you three
to the space station!

165
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:28,473
-Rats!
-This is some scoop!

166
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:37,621
If I turn the power off,
the anti-gravity field will disappear!

167
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,799
St. Tail, you'll be thrown
to the floor!

168
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:56,422
Why doesn't she fall?

169
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,658
The jewel is mine.
I'm not giving it back!

170
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:13,254
What's happening?

171
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:18,062
What's this?

172
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:25,004
This couldn't be...

173
00:17:27,853 --> 00:17:29,980
It's the evil from the moon!

174
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:32,659
No! The jewel is acting as a lens.

175
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:37,663
The moonlight hit it and it's
giving off that blinding glow!

176
00:17:45,218 --> 00:17:46,708
There.

177
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:52,957
I'm taking the Jewel of the Moon
back with me.

178
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,894
St. Tail, stop!

179
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:59,504
Rats! She got away again.

180
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:05,444
Don't get depressed. I have a picture
of her right here in my camera!

181
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:19,436
I am returning your jewel.

182
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:22,777
May you rest in peace.

183
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:31,994
St. Tail, with your help,
I managed to stay clean. Thank you.

184
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:48,888
We're finally going
to uncover St. Tail's identity!

185
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:56,808
-What's this?
-I don't remember taking this!

186
00:18:57,047 --> 00:19:01,780
You lousy reporter, all that talk
about unveiling St. Tail's identity!

187
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:04,149
Shut up, you miserable detective!

188
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,589
-Why, you!
-The same to you!

189
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:10,963
If you're so hot,
why don't you arrest St. Tail?

190
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:13,070
Why, you!
