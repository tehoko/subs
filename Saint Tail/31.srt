1
00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:07,939
Wait a minute!

2
00:00:09,887 --> 00:00:11,980
Hey, Ruby! Wait!

3
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:14,650
Listen...!

4
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:16,959
Meimi! Look this way!

5
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:25,352
Hello!

6
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:31,653
HER TRUE CHARACTER REVEALED!
MEIMI'S CRITICAL MOMENT

7
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,404
Sawatari. What are you doing?

8
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:40,907
Sorry about the last contest.

9
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:45,383
I want to start taking
photos now for the next contest.

10
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,033
You're beautiful
in your school uniform...

11
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:51,507
...but you're also beautiful
when you're playing at home.

12
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:52,580
You're so bad!

13
00:00:53,683 --> 00:00:54,672
Senorita!

14
00:00:56,991 --> 00:01:00,427
I'm leaving now.
See you tomorrow!

15
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,197
May I have a second of your time?

16
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:21,333
Neverland Toy Shop?

17
00:01:22,347 --> 00:01:25,475
Oh, it's the big toy store
that just opened...

18
00:01:25,988 --> 00:01:27,888
...on Second Avenue.

19
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:31,253
Did you know
that there used to be...

20
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:33,335
...a small toy store there, Sister?

21
00:01:34,173 --> 00:01:35,265
Now I remember...

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,249
...there was a very big tree there...

23
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:41,521
Yes...

24
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:47,020
Until a year ago
that was my father's store.

25
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:51,766
But it was taken over.

26
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:54,645
We had to let the store go.

27
00:02:03,138 --> 00:02:06,403
And you came here for help...?

28
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,077
No, I'm all right with the store now.

29
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:14,419
But I need your help with the tree...

30
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,724
...in front of our old store.

31
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:20,030
The tree is still there
as the new store's display.

32
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:23,377
Recently I remembered...

33
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:26,685
...that I left my music box in the tree.

34
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:28,715
I thought that I had lost it.

35
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:31,355
Why did you leave it
in such a high place?

36
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,062
When I was a child,
I often climbed the tree.

37
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:39,179
Recently I was going through...

38
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,808
...my grandfather's belongings.

39
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:42,147
Then I suddenly...

40
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:43,986
...remembered my music box.

41
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:46,427
It must be in the hole in the tree.

42
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,528
It's very important to you, isn't it?

43
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:53,073
Yes. My grandfather gave it to me.

44
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:55,384
It's a souvenir...

45
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:57,853
...from my grandfather's
trip to Switzerland...

46
00:02:58,126 --> 00:02:59,616
...when he was young.

47
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:16,553
Since that time, he was
interested in music boxes...

48
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:20,263
Immediately after coming back...

49
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:22,304
...he opened his toy store.

50
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:25,108
At the time...

51
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,656
... I didn't know the story
behind the music box.

52
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:33,826
But that was my favorite
thing when I was child.

53
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:37,538
I always had it with me,
even when playing or sleeping...

54
00:03:38,682 --> 00:03:42,049
But I misplaced it
without even realizing it.

55
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:47,561
So she wants to get it back, right?

56
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,695
She says it's a beautiful music box...

57
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:52,902
...which plays the hymn,
"Ye Fair Green Hills of Galilee."

58
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:56,881
Naomi has asked
the owner many times...

59
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,221
...to return her music box...

60
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:03,763
No, no.

61
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:07,604
We just opened the store.
We can't take on extra stuff.

62
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:12,014
To others,
it may just be a music box.

63
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:16,383
But to me,
it's something very important.

64
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:18,870
All right!

65
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:21,536
This is a job
for the Mysterious Thief St. Tail!

66
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:26,818
Hey, Asuka!

67
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:28,382
Hey!

68
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,649
How's it going?

69
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:31,128
- Hey, good morning!
- Huh?

70
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:32,966
You have something in your hood.

71
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,107
This method is...?!

72
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:40,150
"Tomorrow night...

73
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:41,844
...I'm going to Neverland
to retrieve a music box...

74
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:44,754
...which plays 'Ye Fair
Green Hills of Galilee.'"

75
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:46,490
St. Tail?!

76
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,690
A note of warning!

77
00:04:50,342 --> 00:04:53,140
As usual, you're caught off guard.

78
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:54,907
Saruwatari...

79
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,547
Are you challenging me
this early in the morning?

80
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:01,321
Oh, no!

81
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,895
Don't touch that!
It's a special photo of Haneoka!

82
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,604
What?!

83
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,557
Oh, it's just a regular...

84
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:19,830
Hey, Asuka Jr.!
Don't touch it with your dirty hand!

85
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:22,342
What's this thing with Meimi?

86
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:24,913
I don't know.

87
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:26,613
Unfortunately...

88
00:05:26,722 --> 00:05:29,247
...I only have eyes
for the beautiful Haneoka.

89
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:34,063
Are you even listening to me?! Hey!

90
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:39,573
I've seen this before!

91
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:45,158
If I remember correctly,
at that time...

92
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:48,290
...it was with St. Tail.

93
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:52,010
Meimi!

94
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:56,009
What...?!

95
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,656
What is it?!

96
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:06,308
Ruby...!

97
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:12,288
This is...

98
00:06:15,196 --> 00:06:18,097
Give it back, Asuka!
I took that picture!

99
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:22,532
Meimi! What is that next to you?

100
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:29,989
What should I do?!

101
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:32,264
That's a...

102
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:35,668
That's a stuffed animal.

103
00:06:36,243 --> 00:06:37,210
Seira...

104
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:40,809
What do you want to do...

105
00:06:40,954 --> 00:06:42,945
...with the stuffed
porcupine, Asuka Jr.?

106
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:44,587
It's a stuffed animal?

107
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:46,486
Yeah, that's right!

108
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:47,657
I know I have to grow...

109
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:49,202
...out of collecting
stuffed animals but...

110
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:52,040
You're in trouble, Meimi.

111
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,371
Let's go.

112
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:55,376
Wait! Meimi!

113
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:56,816
Stop it!

114
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,490
If you're too pushy, she'll hate you.

115
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:05,161
How can you say that...?

116
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:11,446
Thank you, Seira.
You saved me in there.

117
00:07:11,688 --> 00:07:14,623
Anyway, now is
the time to be careful.

118
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:17,861
In school, let's maintain...

119
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:19,560
...that Ruby is a stuffed animal.

120
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:20,773
Yeah.

121
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,605
And Asuka Jr. is still
having doubts about you.

122
00:07:23,782 --> 00:07:25,716
Don't let him provoke you.

123
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:28,188
I know that!

124
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:31,460
Mice is the plural form of mouse.

125
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:33,964
Now I'll read...

126
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:35,800
...from Aesop's Fables...

127
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:38,070
..."The Town Mouse
and the Country Mouse."

128
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:41,705
- PIease listen to me carefully.
- Meimi, I have a favor to ask!

129
00:07:41,922 --> 00:07:43,617
I'm going to buy
concert tickets this afternoon.

130
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:45,349
Can you come with me?

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,967
Meimi.

132
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:52,207
Could you be...?

133
00:08:04,438 --> 00:08:06,565
I don't know why
this bothers you so much...

134
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:09,002
...but do you want me to find out...

135
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:11,045
...if this is a real stuffed animal?

136
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,258
Sawatari, you...

137
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,557
...are nicer than I thought.

138
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:20,092
Of course! We're classmates!

139
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:22,602
Haneoka!

140
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:24,174
For that reason...

141
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:25,613
...please go out on a date with me!

142
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:26,686
Wait a minute!

143
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:28,855
For what reason?!

144
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:33,029
I want to take
another picture of you...

145
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:35,035
...with the stuffed animal.

146
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:36,332
May I?!

147
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:39,905
Uh, I'm sorry, but...

148
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,848
Well, how about
after school tomorrow? All right?

149
00:08:45,897 --> 00:08:47,262
Asuka!

150
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:51,338
Which would you like,
rice balls or sandwiches?

151
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,775
In the middle of this mess,
you're talking about food?

152
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:55,108
What's the matter?

153
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:56,275
Of course I'm talking...

154
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:57,445
...about the snack
for tomorrow night.

155
00:08:57,556 --> 00:08:58,523
You'll get hungry...

156
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,785
...during tomorrow
night's surveillance.

157
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,693
Which one would you like?!

158
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:05,764
Neither! Give me some space!

159
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:16,018
- Sawatari!
- Yes!

160
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,597
I'll go on the date after school!

161
00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:21,395
Me-Meimi...

162
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:23,136
What?! It's my lucky day!

163
00:09:23,714 --> 00:09:24,681
What?!

164
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:31,657
Oh, Lord...

165
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,524
That's why I'm asking
for forgiveness! Seira!

166
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,927
What are you going to do?

167
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,397
Your date and warning note
are on the same day.

168
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:51,434
It will work out somehow...

169
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:54,178
We were able to manage Ruby...

170
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:55,407
...without too much trouble...

171
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,511
But I was careless, too.

172
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:01,887
There are stuffed porcupines...

173
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:05,025
Yeah, I have seen one
at a toy store before.

174
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:06,367
It was a stuffed animal...

175
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:08,467
...with a music box,
and it looks exactly like Ruby.

176
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:12,882
We can buy it and fool Sawatari.

177
00:10:13,558 --> 00:10:14,525
That's not all!

178
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:16,390
The music that plays is also...

179
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:18,290
"Ye Fair Green Hills of Galilee."

180
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:19,803
All right!

181
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:21,601
Then I'm going to get
the stuffed animal...

182
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,836
...that looks like Ruby!

183
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:25,538
Actually...

184
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:27,413
I checked earlier...

185
00:10:28,358 --> 00:10:30,121
...and it's out of stock now.

186
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,663
Out of stock?

187
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:38,542
What should I do, Seira?!

188
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:41,013
There's no other way now...

189
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,007
Ruby, could you do me a favor?

190
00:10:58,992 --> 00:10:59,959
Can you pretend to be...

191
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:01,154
...a stuffed animal
for the rest of the day?

192
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:07,206
- Eimi!
- What?

193
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:09,038
It's another peaceful day.

194
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:10,376
Yes, it is!

195
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:17,487
Oh...?

196
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:18,634
TROUBLE

197
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:21,964
Are you going to take
Ruby to school, Meimi?

198
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:24,343
What? Ruby?

199
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,010
Well, Ruby seems
to have caught a cold.

200
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:31,090
So I'm thinking of
dropping her off at the vet.

201
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:37,137
That's all! I'm going!

202
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:46,993
I managed to fool Dad and Mom...

203
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,832
The harder part
is coming up, Ruby.

204
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,142
Let's hang in there all day today!

205
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:05,161
One hour later.

206
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:10,444
Three hours later.

207
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,546
After school!

208
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:26,074
Haneoka!

209
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:27,883
Where should we go?!

210
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:35,067
Is it going to be okay...?

211
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,442
Well, in our store,
a music box with the hymn...

212
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:44,884
..."Ye Fair Green Hills of Galilee"...

213
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:47,494
...is only sold with this item.

214
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:53,467
That's all?

215
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,379
Yes. They're out of stock now...

216
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,850
...and we have only
this one for display.

217
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,671
I see. So this is the one...

218
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:12,017
...that St. Tail is targeting.

219
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:16,356
Whew! It's a big toy store!

220
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:21,699
That must be the tree
where the music box is...

221
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:28,151
Anything wrong?

222
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,279
Oh, no.

223
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,256
Right now, we're having
a grand opening sale.

224
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:34,760
So we can't close the store,
no matter what.

225
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:40,307
Well, I would like
to borrow something.

226
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:41,816
EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM

227
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,013
Shoot! Why do I have to do...

228
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:46,956
...this?!

229
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:50,300
Asuka Jr. ...!

230
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,053
This time your strategy...

231
00:13:58,156 --> 00:13:59,885
...is to disguise yourself
and then catch her, isn't it?!

232
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:01,291
Aha! Great idea!

233
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,895
Yeah, right...!

234
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,675
Cute!

235
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:12,842
Sawatari! Hey!

236
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,754
I don't know any fox.

237
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:18,523
It's me! Me!

238
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:21,233
What are you doing
in that costume?

239
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:26,939
I... I am doing this...
in order to catch St. Tail...

240
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:28,248
It doesn't really matter.

241
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:31,451
But you do look good
in that costume!

242
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,222
Shut up!

243
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:36,164
Enough about me!
What can you report?

244
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:40,946
It's a stuffed animal. Probably!

245
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:43,687
Really, you can't see past...

246
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,859
...Meimi, can you?!

247
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:47,189
I'll look into it myself.

248
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:00,249
What's the matter, Haneoka?

249
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:03,826
As you can see, it's a fox.
Come on! Let's go!

250
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,919
I just want to know...

251
00:15:13,055 --> 00:15:14,784
...if that's really a stuffed animal.

252
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:15,983
That's all!

253
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:18,662
Oops. Sorry!

254
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:30,219
Great!

255
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:32,659
A smiling fox is
falling down the stairs!

256
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:36,698
Ohhhh, ouch...

257
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,603
I knew the way
that fox fell was familiar.

258
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:41,182
It's like I thought...

259
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:47,023
This isn't good!

260
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:50,534
Oh, no! I've caught a cold!

261
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,880
What should I do, Seira?!

262
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:06,234
Here she comes! St. Tail!

263
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:09,270
I won't let you escape today!

264
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:11,615
Where?!

265
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:16,619
Disappeared?

266
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,357
Where is she?!

267
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:25,274
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

268
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:31,294
One!

269
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:34,869
Two!

270
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:39,906
Three!

271
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,877
She just appeared
on top of the tree!

272
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,363
For me, it was pretty good.

273
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:10,370
May the blessings
of God be with us.

274
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:13,113
Good evening, everyone!

275
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,323
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

276
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,859
Don't move, St. Tail!

277
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:26,273
It's...

278
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:30,622
...Show...

279
00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:33,730
...Time!

280
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:48,527
My store...!

281
00:17:51,073 --> 00:17:52,472
Oh, shoot!

282
00:17:56,384 --> 00:17:57,373
There it is!

283
00:17:57,487 --> 00:17:58,886
I'm taking the music
box with the hymn...

284
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,082
..."Ye Fair Green Hills of Galilee!"

285
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:03,094
What? I thought there
was only one music box...

286
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,144
Oh, she's gone...!

287
00:18:19,937 --> 00:18:21,734
You couldn't catch her once again!

288
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:28,016
Shut up!

289
00:18:28,322 --> 00:18:29,721
Where did you get
the one on your back?!

290
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:31,885
Oh, this?

291
00:18:32,464 --> 00:18:34,159
I bought it before
the store was out of stock.

292
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:50,626
I see. It's a stuffed animal...

293
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:52,765
Of course it is!

294
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:54,910
What's the matter?

295
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:58,378
Of course it is...

296
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:01,315
Rather than thinking too much...

297
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:02,623
...I should just catch her!

298
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:04,197
When I catch her...

299
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:06,065
...everything will become clear.

300
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,013
Ruby, I love you!
