1
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:18,691
She's an angel! It's like
an angel is riding a horse!

2
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:22,103
I've never seen
such a beautiful lady!

3
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:24,706
I wish I were that horse!

4
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:27,678
I'll be the horse's rear legs!

5
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:30,518
Angel?! If she had wings...

6
00:00:30,627 --> 00:00:32,322
...she wouldn't have
to ride on the horse!

7
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:34,031
They're so stupid!

8
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:36,658
Rear legs? Is he talking about
a two-man horse in a play?!

9
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:39,670
What about a two-man
horse in a play?

10
00:00:39,977 --> 00:00:41,638
It's stupid boy-talk.

11
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:43,906
They're talking about
the princess of their dreams.

12
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:47,551
On their way to school
there's a mansion.

13
00:00:47,692 --> 00:00:51,685
In the large yard, a lady
who gracefully rides a horse...

14
00:00:51,934 --> 00:00:54,903
...is the Madonna
that the boys are admiring.

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,241
They sneak by to watch her
every day on their way home.

16
00:00:58,346 --> 00:00:59,506
How perverted!

17
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:01,339
Oh, is that so?

18
00:01:02,153 --> 00:01:04,644
I wonder if Asuka Jr.
goes there, too...

19
00:01:06,194 --> 00:01:07,991
Is she that pretty?

20
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:10,027
What?! You haven't seen her?!

21
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:11,158
- No.
- Well, then...

22
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,599
I can take you there today!

23
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:15,741
No, thank you.

24
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,511
I'm not that interested.

25
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:20,978
Man! Asuka's head is...

26
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,454
...filled only with
thoughts of St. Tail.

27
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:34,035
RETURN THE THOROUGHBRED!

28
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:50,343
You are...?

29
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:09,707
What?! She was cheated
and lost the horse...

30
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:11,146
...that the boys
were talking about?

31
00:02:11,552 --> 00:02:14,521
Yes. The horse's name is Billy.

32
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:18,722
Both Billy's father and mother
were very famous racehorses.

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,031
He's a top-notch Thoroughbred.

34
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:24,636
But that Madonna, rather,
Ms. Maki Nishina was against...

35
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,302
...turning him into a racehorse.

36
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,980
So he became a riding horse.

37
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,593
That's a very extravagant
thing to do, isn't it?

38
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:39,059
If he's so famous,
he's worth quite a bit.

39
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:41,505
Like they say, she must be
an extremely rich princess!

40
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:44,070
Yes. And according
to some people...

41
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,445
...she's wasting a fortune.

42
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:50,720
A man named Soma
kept visiting Maki's house...

43
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:53,693
...asking her to sell Billy to him.

44
00:02:55,168 --> 00:02:58,103
But Maki flatly refused his offer.

45
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:00,775
But Soma wouldn't
give up, and one day...

46
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:22,940
Well, hello, Lady Maki.

47
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,447
I won't sell Billy.

48
00:03:24,556 --> 00:03:25,648
No matter how many
times you come here...

49
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:26,850
...the answer remains the same.

50
00:03:27,062 --> 00:03:28,723
Now, hold on.

51
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:33,836
I've got a wonderful idea
that may appeal to you.

52
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,601
First, please look at this horse.

53
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:40,683
He's Wild Bunch.

54
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,516
He's from a very
famous bloodline.

55
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:48,521
He is as good as your Billy.

56
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:54,598
This horse isn't
a bad trade for Billy.

57
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:57,576
Don't you get it?

58
00:03:58,053 --> 00:03:59,680
I love Billy!

59
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,558
I'll never give him
to someone like you!

60
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:15,184
Billy!

61
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,081
What's happened?!

62
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:19,826
It's broken!

63
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:25,334
What are you going to do?
His leg is broken!

64
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:32,874
The medical report
Soma brought definitely stated...

65
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:35,151
...that the leg
was broken, Maki said.

66
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:37,057
I've heard that a broken leg is...

67
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:40,422
...the same as
a death sentence for a horse.

68
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:43,896
Yes. That's why Soma
demanded Billy in exchange...

69
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:47,507
...as if he had
the right to take Billy.

70
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:52,078
She said her father
couldn't refuse.

71
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:54,618
But something is strange.

72
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,123
Things were
too convenient for Soma.

73
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:00,465
Only Soma is winning here.

74
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,207
You mean...!

75
00:05:02,777 --> 00:05:05,211
Yes. Maki is thinking that, too.

76
00:05:05,748 --> 00:05:08,273
She thinks they were
set up from the beginning.

77
00:05:08,821 --> 00:05:10,789
Soma wanted Billy very badly.

78
00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:13,758
And the horse's
broken leg was supported...

79
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:15,655
...only by the medical report.

80
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:19,270
He tricked them
in order to get Billy.

81
00:05:19,842 --> 00:05:23,005
He had no intention
of giving up his horse, either.

82
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,884
Maki thinks so, too.

83
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:29,013
She thinks they
somehow surprised Billy...

84
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:31,659
...and made him
fall into that horse.

85
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,797
Yes! That must be it!

86
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:39,004
But Soma has already
become the legal owner of Billy.

87
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:42,447
Billy and Maki
will never be together.

88
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:44,153
All right!

89
00:05:44,255 --> 00:05:46,849
Under such circumstances,
St. Tail can get the horse back!

90
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:50,056
In addition, I'll reveal
Soma's evil intentions.

91
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:53,026
But Billy is already scheduled...

92
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:56,073
...to go to a ranch
in Hokkaido tonight.

93
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:58,034
And by train!

94
00:05:58,749 --> 00:05:59,716
Train?!

95
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:03,379
It's the K-Express,
leaving Seika Station at 8:02.

96
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:05,617
We have only four hours
until its departure.

97
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:06,696
Please hurry.

98
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:20,351
What short notice!

99
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,520
Did he go home?

100
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:24,128
How can I send him
a warning note?

101
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,696
Hey, have you seen Asuka Jr.?

102
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,962
No, I haven't.

103
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:30,663
Didn't he go home already?

104
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,471
Really? Thank you.

105
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:36,309
There is no other way.

106
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:38,589
It may be a bit much, but I guess
I should use that method.

107
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:52,140
Tonight...

108
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:54,481
...I'll get Billy
from the K-Express train...

109
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:56,453
...leaving Seika Station at 8:02.

110
00:06:58,329 --> 00:06:59,296
St. Tail?

111
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:00,899
It's a warning note...!

112
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:03,029
It's elaborate...

113
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:05,705
Dad! Let me borrow
your train schedule!

114
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,468
The one you always
use for your trips.

115
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:09,312
All right.

116
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:12,153
Here it is.

117
00:07:12,322 --> 00:07:13,687
Thanks, Dad.

118
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:18,261
But why do you need it, Meimi?

119
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:20,358
Well... for something...!

120
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:25,445
Mom!

121
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:26,514
- Mom!
- What?

122
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:28,140
Is Meimi going on a trip?

123
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:29,911
Not that I know of.
I haven't heard anything about it.

124
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:33,052
I wonder if she's running away...

125
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:38,222
If so, she wouldn't borrow
the schedule from you.

126
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:40,608
That's true.

127
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,442
There are a lot of things
going on at her age.

128
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:48,079
It's a difficult age...

129
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:56,593
Let's see...
the K-Express departs at 8:02...

130
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,165
It will pass that point at...

131
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:02,382
All right!

132
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:05,084
SEIKA STATION

133
00:08:35,713 --> 00:08:36,737
What did you say?!

134
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,952
St. Tail is coming to steal Billy?!

135
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:41,022
Yes.

136
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:44,025
We'll be aboard the train
to protect the horse.

137
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,254
Don't worry.

138
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,294
Here comes the train.

139
00:09:02,531 --> 00:09:05,932
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

140
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:12,048
One!

141
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,488
Two!

142
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:20,025
Three!

143
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:38,689
May the blessings
of God be with us.

144
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:59,465
There are no suspicious
persons on board.

145
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:00,941
All right!

146
00:10:01,243 --> 00:10:03,040
Position yourselves
at each place.

147
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:06,479
No! Let me go!

148
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,153
Please let me go!

149
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,954
What's the commotion,
Mr. Soma?

150
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:15,792
Well, this young lady
was doing a bad thing.

151
00:10:16,372 --> 00:10:18,431
She was trying to open
the door of the livestock car...

152
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,203
...and let Billy escape.

153
00:10:25,522 --> 00:10:27,581
I beg you! Please return Billy!

154
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,719
You're going too far, young lady.

155
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:32,558
Billy is mine now.

156
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,561
You don't have the right
to even touch him.

157
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:37,097
Don't make me laugh!

158
00:10:37,277 --> 00:10:39,245
I know you set us up!

159
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:41,540
There was no way Billy
would get upset like that!

160
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:42,846
You made him upset!

161
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:44,981
He made Billy upset?

162
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:46,059
What are you talking about?!

163
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:48,527
Don't say something
so stupid without any evidence!

164
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:50,899
Never come close to this horse!

165
00:10:52,473 --> 00:10:53,462
Understand?!

166
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:57,945
Who on earth are you?

167
00:10:59,386 --> 00:11:00,375
Billy...

168
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:17,444
Billy! Billy!

169
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:20,759
Billy!

170
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:24,833
Billy!

171
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,901
Billy!

172
00:11:26,036 --> 00:11:27,003
Billy!

173
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:31,645
Billy!

174
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:42,199
Billy!

175
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:47,710
Billy...

176
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:51,745
Billy!

177
00:11:57,162 --> 00:11:59,824
I see. I understand the situation.

178
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:02,734
I'm not doing anything wrong.

179
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:06,937
I suppose that girl
can't let go of Billy.

180
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:12,011
But St. Tail always has
a good reason for stealing things.

181
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:16,621
Rather than worrying about that,
how about your security?

182
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,425
Even that girl
was able to get close.

183
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,972
Don't worry.

184
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:23,976
We have one officer on each car...

185
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:27,678
...and two officers
in front of the livestock car.

186
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:30,246
I 'II be at the livestock car, too.

187
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:32,619
So it's impossible to break in.

188
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:34,823
I'm counting on you.

189
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:40,042
I know that!

190
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,874
First, check the car.

191
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:13,166
That must be Soma.

192
00:13:13,574 --> 00:13:15,269
I wonder what they're talking about.

193
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,207
Darn! Why is Billy singled out?!

194
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:21,784
St. Tail wants him, too.

195
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:24,423
That means Billy
is a very good horse.

196
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:28,257
Of course he is!
That's the reason I fell in love with him.

197
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:31,232
He'll bring us a lot of money.

198
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:33,405
But that was a good idea.

199
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:36,005
You invented
Wild Bunch's broken leg.

200
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:39,346
You blamed it on Billy,
and then you got him for free.

201
00:13:41,093 --> 00:13:45,325
The key was to use the fact
that the girl didn't want to sell him...

202
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:48,598
...coupled with your special talent.

203
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,104
It's like we thought.
That's how they did it!

204
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:09,333
Now that we know,
I'll take Billy no matter what.

205
00:14:16,226 --> 00:14:18,456
The livestock car
is the very last one.

206
00:14:18,564 --> 00:14:21,397
Naturally, Asuka Jr. is
keeping it under surveillance.

207
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,662
If that's the case...

208
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:28,739
How's it going?
Is there anything unusual?

209
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:30,512
No. Nothing so far.

210
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,644
Thank you.

211
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,477
This is Asuka! I've found St. Tail!

212
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,782
Everyone! Get up on the roof!

213
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:55,699
Bad news!

214
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,233
I was checking it out...

215
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:00,330
...and there's no officer
in the next car or anywhere!

216
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:02,034
What?!

217
00:15:02,347 --> 00:15:03,609
What's going on?

218
00:15:03,716 --> 00:15:05,513
What happened
to the kid, Asuka?!

219
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:06,984
I didn't see him, either.

220
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:08,681
Maybe something happened.

221
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:11,226
I'm worried about Billy.

222
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:12,620
Let's go!

223
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:13,756
Yes!

224
00:15:15,138 --> 00:15:17,436
Don't move, St. Tail!

225
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:21,845
Give up now!
There's nowhere to run!

226
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:32,063
Wait a minute.
Isn't it strange that St. Tail...

227
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:36,106
...shows up in the front
when Billy is in the back?

228
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,617
It's...

229
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:48,957
...Show...

230
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:52,196
...Time!

231
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,458
Darn it!

232
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:15,105
Shoot! Someone's on the roof!

233
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,762
Like we thought, it's St. Tail...

234
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,667
What are you doing?!

235
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:29,601
Ignore him! Shoot!

236
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:43,027
Stop it!

237
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:45,631
Get off of me! Get off!

238
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:46,768
Asuka Jr.!

239
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,579
Duck!

240
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:52,914
St. Tail!

241
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:09,709
St. Tail...

242
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:20,875
One!

243
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:22,402
Two!

244
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:25,809
Three!

245
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:36,535
She was all right...!

246
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,542
What a stunt!

247
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:45,952
I'll definitely catch you next time!

248
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:52,026
I'll let you see
your lady pretty soon.

249
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,707
What's the matter, Billy?

250
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:12,297
Billy!

251
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:16,815
Billy!

252
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,050
Billy!

253
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:38,483
I'm glad...

254
00:18:39,426 --> 00:18:42,452
...that Soma's wrong-doing
was revealed to the police, too.

255
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:46,662
So Billy is formally
returned to Maki.

256
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:49,067
Of course.

257
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:51,340
But it's terrible.

258
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:52,907
He made up the story
about the broken leg...

259
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:54,313
...and faked the medical report...

260
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:57,113
...and he upset Billy
by hitting him with a BB.

261
00:18:57,593 --> 00:18:59,424
Really! I can't believe it!

262
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:03,158
I wonder if Maki is riding Billy now.

263
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:05,502
She looked very cool!

264
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:07,572
The boys shouldn't
be the only ones...

265
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,805
...to view her as an angel.
