1
00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:02,333
-Bye!
-No breakfast?

2
00:00:02,575 --> 00:00:05,874
No, thanks! I'm late!

3
00:00:11,092 --> 00:00:13,993
That hurts!
Watch where you're driving!

4
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:17,257
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, really! Be careful!

5
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:20,140
Are you all right?

6
00:00:23,182 --> 00:00:24,945
Are you hurt?

7
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:27,178
No.

8
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:35,199
Please accept our deepest apologies.

9
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:39,602
I'll be late for school!

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,014
Master Ryutaro, she forgot it.

11
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:48,252
I'm almost positive
it's a St. Paulia School hat.

12
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:49,690
I've found her.

13
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:55,698
MEIMI IS ENGAGED
TO A MULTI-MILLIONAIRE'S SON!?

14
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:06,455
-Don't be depressed about being tardy.
-Sister's lecture is starting.

15
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:08,460
Good, if that's all it is.

16
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:12,535
It might be the Board Chairman
who will give you a lecture.

17
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:15,801
You're kidding!
I was only late for school!

18
00:01:16,048 --> 00:01:19,449
Meimi! Please come
to the Chairman's office.

19
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:21,384
Yes.

20
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:28,635
Don't you think something's strange?

21
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:32,673
-Oh, it's you, Saruwatari.
-The name's Sawatari!

22
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:34,438
What's so strange?

23
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:39,053
Do you think you'd be called to
the Chairman's office for being tardy?

24
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:43,285
-Who knows?
-I think this is gonna be a scoop!

25
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:50,306
-Meimi, come here.
-Yes!

26
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:54,146
I'm very sorry!
I was tardy because a car--

27
00:01:54,388 --> 00:01:58,757
She's the one! No mistake!
She's the one I've been looking for!

28
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:00,258
You're--

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,494
I'm very sorry about this morning.
My name is Ryutaro Tomikoji.

30
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:10,637
This morning you dropped your hat.
This gentleman came to return it.

31
00:02:10,886 --> 00:02:13,081
Thank you very much.

32
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:15,792
And also it's very sudden...

33
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:20,465
...but Mr. Tomikoji requests that
he be given the chance to date you.

34
00:02:20,872 --> 00:02:22,965
Date? With me?

35
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,478
This meeting is a God-given destiny.

36
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:29,673
Love at first sight is
what you'd call it.

37
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:32,652
It's all so sudden and...

38
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:38,629
Meimi, if you accept, we shall
forget the tardy incident.

39
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,573
Well, he's a most courteous young man.

40
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:46,044
To go out of his way for permission
to date one of our students.

41
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:47,618
You're correct.

42
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:51,148
Everyone tells me so.

43
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,791
I understand.

44
00:02:56,038 --> 00:02:57,437
Are you sure?

45
00:02:57,675 --> 00:03:02,476
I was sure you'd give that reply.
Well, it's time we leave for our date.

46
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:06,710
Please take good care
of our Meimi. And now...

47
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:12,186
Regarding the contribution, I will
have a company employee prepare it.

48
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:13,664
Thank you very much.

49
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:16,669
Contribution? I've been sold.

50
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:22,079
-Then we'll be back.
- Have a nice time.

51
00:03:26,061 --> 00:03:28,256
Scoop!

52
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:32,571
It's a scoop.

53
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,181
A simple park like this
can be quite refreshing.

54
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,911
I couldn't think of anywhere
for a date.

55
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,026
I think your pureness is so cute.

56
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,836
That's it!
I should ask him for the impossible.

57
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:53,009
Then he'd be convinced
to forget this date.

58
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:56,282
-I've thought of something!
-Wherever you wish.

59
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,048
I'd like to eat at Tetsujin-tei
and go to a musical at Bayside Hall.

60
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:05,925
-Let's not forget Wonderland Garden.
-OK. Let's get going.

61
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,887
What a long line!

62
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:21,894
Meimi, what's the matter?
The entrance is over here.

63
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,438
But we've got to stand in line.

64
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:32,342
We came in without standing in line.
Are you sure it's OK?

65
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:37,082
Mother is sponsor of this restaurant
so we can come in anytime.

66
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,322
I see. Ryutaro, your mother
is quite a woman.

67
00:04:40,804 --> 00:04:45,537
Yes. After Father's death, she's been
running the company by herself.

68
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,044
But she does too much
when it comes to me.

69
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:53,312
Like deciding my fiancee.
I'd like to decide on my own fiancee.

70
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:57,926
-You're right.
-Well, the musical is next, isn't it?

71
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,834
Yes. Could you possibly be sponsors
of the Bayside Hall as well?

72
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:05,681
You're kidding.

73
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,912
But Mother has special reserved seats
so there's no need to worry.

74
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:14,892
This guy has no idea
what standing in line is.

75
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,262
-Shall we go?
-Wait.

76
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:20,939
My parents will be worried
if I'm late.

77
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,306
You're right.

78
00:05:22,549 --> 00:05:27,384
Next time, we'll get permission
from your parents and enjoy our date.

79
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:29,184
I'll take you home.

80
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,694
Don't worry. I can get home
by myself. Goodbye.

81
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:36,668
Meimi! You're shy, aren't you?

82
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,653
This is the fourth day. No matter
what Sister says, I'm exhausted.

83
00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:47,087
Meimi, don't be such a spoilsport!

84
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:51,026
She's right. You get to go
to all the popular places.

85
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:55,867
It's God's teachings. That's what you
get for accepting a date so easily.

86
00:05:56,414 --> 00:06:00,407
Oh, Seira. I'm leaving from
the back gate so he won't catch me.

87
00:06:00,655 --> 00:06:02,816
I'm leaving the rest to you.

88
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:12,736
Young lady, we've been waiting
for you. Shall we go?

89
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:15,244
Yes.

90
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:22,226
Is something troubling you?

91
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:26,190
If you're OK with it,
I'd be glad to listen.

92
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:32,377
Someone switched the heirloom necklace
my mother left me with a fake one.

93
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:39,486
-This is it.
-What? This shop?

94
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:42,495
Mother is the sponsor
of this boutique.

95
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,703
Is that so?

96
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,876
-I'd like to select something for you.
-You don't have to buy me clothes.

97
00:06:50,116 --> 00:06:54,212
You're meeting my mother,
so please be conscious of your dress.

98
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,685
Meet your mother?

99
00:06:56,193 --> 00:06:59,788
Yes. Tomorrow evening,
Mother's having a party.

100
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:02,663
I want to introduce you
as my fiancee there.

101
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:06,603
Fiancee? You can't do that!
I have no intentions to--

102
00:07:06,847 --> 00:07:09,042
I'm still a junior high student!

103
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:14,154
You didn't hear the Chairman? I'm
dating you with intentions to marry.

104
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:17,296
I've heard nothing of the sort!

105
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:20,366
It's a scoop!

106
00:07:23,078 --> 00:07:25,308
Good morning.

107
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,383
-The news is all over the class!
-Is it true he proposed?

108
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,293
He's the son of the owner
of the Tomikoji Group!

109
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:38,698
How do all of you know?

110
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:42,002
Looks like the source of the news
is from over there.

111
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:46,207
Asuka Jr., have you seen it?
It's my greatest scoop! Hey, Asuka Jr.!

112
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:49,319
Be quiet!
Are you a show business reporter?

113
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:50,789
Don't get so upset.

114
00:07:51,032 --> 00:07:53,933
-I said, be quiet, Saruwatari!
-It's Sawatari!

115
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,401
If you don't like Saruwatari,
how about Sawagani?

116
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:02,681
That's jealousy.
Hey, Meimi, Miss Popular?

117
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:10,056
Meimi, I'm sorry to disturb you
when you're so busy.

118
00:08:10,301 --> 00:08:14,260
Oh, Seira, you too! Don't be mean.
It's work, isn't it?

119
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:17,743
The job is for Miss Yumi Imamura.

120
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:22,544
She was a secretary for that
woman entrepreneur, Madam Ranko.

121
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,954
But Madam Ranko has switched...

122
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:29,998
...her mother's heirloom necklace
with a fake one.

123
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:32,271
What's that?

124
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:37,342
President, this isn't the necklace
that I left with you the other day.

125
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:40,615
What in the world
are you talking about?

126
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:43,293
Are you saying
I replaced it with a fake?

127
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:47,262
I know the real one.
Please give it back to me!

128
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:49,200
Stop this right now!

129
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:53,310
If you don't trust me,
then you don't have to work here.

130
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,882
Leave here at once!

131
00:08:56,155 --> 00:09:00,455
Yumi, who complained to Madam Ranko,
lost her job as secretary.

132
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:02,891
What a terrible woman!

133
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,630
I understand.
Just leave things to St. Tail!

134
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,139
This is the fake necklace.

135
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,476
It seems that Madam Ranko always
has the real one on her.

136
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:17,987
And your only chance is the party
that's being held tomorrow night.

137
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,664
Wait, tomorrow's party?
Is it...?

138
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:25,866
Right. Madam Ranko's real name
is Ranko Tomikoji...

139
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:27,874
...Ryutaro's mother.

140
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:33,386
The party tomorrow will include
foreign diplomats and other VIPs...

141
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:36,459
...so the security will be
quite tight.

142
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:38,360
What are you saying?

143
00:09:38,803 --> 00:09:43,797
I think the best way to get in is
to go to that party with Ryutaro.

144
00:09:44,045 --> 00:09:47,913
Seira! Do you know what
going to that party means?

145
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:51,247
I won't! I'll get in there
on my very own!

146
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,994
Meimi.

147
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:10,623
Hey, Asuka Jr.! Kick the ball!

148
00:10:11,564 --> 00:10:14,089
Sure. Just wait.

149
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:31,555
Tonight at the party hall, I'll be
picking up Madam Ranko 's necklace.

150
00:10:32,103 --> 00:10:34,071
A notice from St. Tail!

151
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:35,899
Hey, Asuka Jr.

152
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:39,437
What are you going
to do about this ball?

153
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:44,850
-I'm home!
-Welcome home, Papa.

154
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:47,325
Welcome home. I'll get tea for you.

155
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:50,296
Thanks, but, Mama...

156
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,501
It's beautiful!
I've always wanted one like this!

157
00:10:56,817 --> 00:11:01,481
OK, you're getting sleepy.
One, two, three!

158
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,928
Wow! Papa, is this hypnotism?

159
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,968
But it's still in the research stage.

160
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:14,270
All right, when I count to three,
you'll become a cat.

161
00:11:14,518 --> 00:11:17,453
One, two, three!

162
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:25,130
I'd say it's quite good.

163
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:29,865
When I count to three, you'll
return to normal. Three, two, one.

164
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:33,442
What? I...?

165
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:36,656
Mother, you were a cat a minute ago.

166
00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:39,418
You used me as a guinea pig,
didn't you?

167
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:44,034
-I'm sorry. Here's the pendant.
-You won't get away with that!

168
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:47,003
-Forgive me!
-No, I won't!

169
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,908
Shall we go? We're in the way.

170
00:11:57,432 --> 00:11:59,798
Good evening.

171
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:06,942
I knew you'd come to the party
without telling your parents.

172
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,310
Ryutaro!

173
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:12,080
Shall we go?
But that dress just won't do.

174
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:14,818
-Old man, bring it to me.
-Yes, sir.

175
00:12:15,065 --> 00:12:17,260
What do you mean by "it"?

176
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:21,997
He'll bring the dress I selected
for you, so please change.

177
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,405
Young lady.

178
00:12:28,357 --> 00:12:29,847
Isn't it beautiful?

179
00:12:30,795 --> 00:12:34,128
Got no choice.
I'll have to do as Seira said.

180
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:36,836
Plus, that's a nice dress.

181
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:48,183
I don't need the security. As you
ca n see, I have the necklace on.

182
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:52,661
But St. Tail is able
to steal from anywhere!

183
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:57,599
As I've said, that is why
we've hired our own security guards.

184
00:12:57,846 --> 00:13:02,112
Also, to have you roam around
dressed like that is a nuisance.

185
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:06,622
I don't mind if you do your security
but do it outside.

186
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:09,594
Please wait! I'm not finished.

187
00:13:13,744 --> 00:13:15,041
Darn it.

188
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:26,998
Asuka Jr.

189
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,935
-Meimi.
-Yes.

190
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,210
Meimi.

191
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,697
Meimi. He really proposed to her.

192
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,566
That woman over there is my mother.

193
00:14:05,274 --> 00:14:06,798
That's the necklace.

194
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:08,171
- Meimi.
-Yes?

195
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,212
Let's have one dance
before I introduce you.

196
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:16,288
- No, thanks. I can't dance.
-I'll teach you.

197
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:24,203
-Meimi, you're quite good.
-Thank you.

198
00:14:24,444 --> 00:14:27,072
Where's Madam Ranko?

199
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:29,912
There!

200
00:14:30,155 --> 00:14:33,682
Ryutaro, I feel a bit ill.

201
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:35,794
Would you like a drink?

202
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:40,026
No, don't worry. I'll be fine
with a bit of fresh air.

203
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,444
Wonder if she's OK.

204
00:14:55,502 --> 00:14:59,404
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

205
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,419
One!

206
00:15:07,726 --> 00:15:09,717
Two!

207
00:15:11,032 --> 00:15:14,024
Three!

208
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:31,490
May the blessings of God be with us.

209
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:36,076
-What's this?
-Where's the lights?

210
00:15:36,313 --> 00:15:38,247
What's going on?

211
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:44,016
My necklace is gone!

212
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:45,991
It's St. Tail!

213
00:15:46,232 --> 00:15:48,427
She's appeared! Let's go!

214
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,902
-It's St. Tail!
-Hurry! Hurry! Get it back!

215
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:55,674
Out of the way!

216
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:59,285
I'll be leaving with the necklace.

217
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,068
It's...

218
00:16:06,504 --> 00:16:09,405
...Show...

219
00:16:11,814 --> 00:16:13,304
...Time!

220
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:19,850
Oh, no!

221
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:24,763
Darn it! I won't let you escape!

222
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:27,565
Hold it!

223
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:33,614
Wait! St. Tail!

224
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:37,417
I'm the one
who's gonna catch St. Tail!

225
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,024
Wait!

226
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:45,740
Oh, boy. Why is Ryutaro here?
That's it. It'd be just right!

227
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:54,952
Miss St. Tail,
I'd like to talk to you.

228
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:01,800
One, two, three!

229
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:09,083
Take this fake back to your mother.

230
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:12,259
St. Tail, you won't escape this time!

231
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:21,199
Asuka Jr., please take care of him!

232
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:23,204
What a dirty trick!

233
00:17:23,784 --> 00:17:26,548
Three, two, one!

234
00:17:31,164 --> 00:17:34,395
Rats! What a coward!

235
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:51,162
Take good care of this memory
of your mother.

236
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,133
Thank you, God.

237
00:17:56,513 --> 00:17:57,775
Mother.

238
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:03,714
Ryutaro! You got it back
for me, didn't you?

239
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:06,223
She doesn't know it's fake!

240
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:09,730
As a reward, I'll do
anything you want me to!

241
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:14,705
Really? Then I don't want to marry
the person you decided on.

242
00:18:14,948 --> 00:18:17,917
You're not introducing me
to your mother now!

243
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:21,652
I want to marry St. Tail!

244
00:18:22,696 --> 00:18:28,191
Her long, graceful movements.
Beautiful hair. Her long, slim legs.

245
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,637
Meeting her is a God-given destiny.

246
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:35,846
Young lady, I'm very sorry.

247
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,820
Looks like Master Ryutaro's got
that illness again.

248
00:18:41,398 --> 00:18:45,425
So, what's everybody
gonna say about me?

249
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:52,245
Yumi was very happy that
the necklace was returned to her.

250
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:56,854
Hey! Too bad about
Mr. Prince Charming, Meimi.

251
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:01,794
Oh, cut it out! Love at first sight
is a big pain in the butt.

252
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:04,699
Sorry, sorry.
Well, I'm going on ahead.

253
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,107
Asuka Jr. seems to be in a good mood.

254
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:10,317
Sure does.

255
00:19:10,554 --> 00:19:12,749
It's nice to see him smiling again.
