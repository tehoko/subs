1
00:00:12,155 --> 00:00:13,486
A little to the right. Lower...

2
00:00:20,873 --> 00:00:22,841
Saint Paulia School Festival

3
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:25,675
St. Paulia Academy's festival
is almost here.

4
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:30,683
Our school has a little ritual
that has become a tradition.

5
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,773
Tada! Feast your eyes.
This is Mikami's locker key.

6
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:42,380
Really? The real thing?

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,844
I'm gonna hang it up on the roof.

8
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:47,719
Meimi, what's this about a lock?

9
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:51,163
It's a charm.

10
00:00:51,337 --> 00:00:54,306
Honestly Seira, you're so dense
when it comes to things like this.

11
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:58,908
Okay? If there's a boy you like,
you get hold of his lock...

12
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:01,754
then attach it to the fence
on the east side of the roof...

13
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:06,361
then, at the festival's finale,
that boy will ask you to dance.

14
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,499
So that's why that fence
is covered with locks.

15
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:15,613
That's right. It proves that you have
his feelings locked to yours.

16
00:01:17,693 --> 00:01:21,459
The big problem is how to get
the lock there in the first place.

17
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:25,794
Ryoko, please, please
ask Yamamoto for me.

18
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,978
What? No way!

19
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:30,442
Hey, I've got the curtain!

20
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:38,964
I wonder if he's
already given his lock to someone.

21
00:01:42,678 --> 00:01:44,805
Asuka, put your leg in here.

22
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,813
What for? Like this?

23
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:48,611
Heave!

24
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:50,749
Hey! Hey! What are you guys doing?!

25
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:56,063
Junior in a bag, ready to go!

26
00:01:56,373 --> 00:01:59,433
Do you think doing this kind
of thing to someone is funny?!

27
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,481
I guess I have
nothing to worry about.

28
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,057
The Scoop Picture Causes
Trouble at the School Fair

29
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:22,818
Is anything troubling you?

30
00:02:23,564 --> 00:02:25,429
You can tell me if you like.

31
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:35,310
Miss Mimori... I mean, sister,
have you heard?

32
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,082
About how to get a partner
for the festival's dance party?

33
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:41,789
Oh that, yes.

34
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:44,696
Lucky, I just heard about it.

35
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:52,248
A friend of mine asked me
to get this boy's lock for her today.

36
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:59,554
But when I went to talk to him, Sawatari
from the school paper took our picture.

37
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:14,067
Sawatari!

38
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,761
Yeah, that shot was okay.

39
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,070
Sawatari, wait!

40
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:25,357
What are you going
to do with that picture?

41
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:29,229
Put it in the school paper, of course.

42
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,808
I'll call it 'The Trading of Love Tokens'.
How's that?

43
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,051
You can't do that.
I was only doing a favor for a friend.

44
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:44,651
That won't show on the picture,
so it's not my problem.

45
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,002
You can't...

46
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:54,450
The problem is,
I already have a boyfriend.

47
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,987
If that picture is published,
it'll cause a huge misunderstanding.

48
00:04:03,774 --> 00:04:05,071
That's terrible.

49
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,148
Sawatari is that guy who will
do anything for a story, isn't he?

50
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,157
He's also quite popular
with the girls in the school...

51
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,834
Yes, I know. I hope there's some way
we can get that film from him.

52
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,506
Alright, I'm all fired up!

53
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:27,180
St. Tail will teach that enemy
of girls a lesson!

54
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:32,354
The big problem is,
we don't have much time.

55
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:37,033
Can you send your challenge out
before he develops the pictures?

56
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,411
I understand.

57
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,209
But when will be a
good time to do the job?

58
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,715
Let's see.

59
00:04:41,954 --> 00:04:46,050
The Festival is the day after tomorrow.
All the students will be staying late.

60
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:50,231
Everyone's free to wear
a costume during the festival.

61
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:52,463
That should be the perfect day.

62
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:54,143
Huh?

63
00:04:54,981 --> 00:05:00,715
It wouldn't look suspicious to see
one or two people dressed as St. Tail.

64
00:05:02,397 --> 00:05:03,728
That's right!

65
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,131
What?!

66
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,377
A St. Tail costume?!

67
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:13,610
That's right! See!

68
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:18,856
We made it for you because, being so
athletic, you're perfect for the part!

69
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:20,225
Now wait a minute.

70
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:22,735
Let's rehearse for tomorrow.

71
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,433
You're right. Let's dress her!

72
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,601
And your hair has
got to be in a ponytail!

73
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:27,874
Hey! Hold it!

74
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:29,441
Relax, just relax.

75
00:05:29,755 --> 00:05:31,655
This is just plain silly.

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,356
Don't fidget.

77
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:35,760
You girls! You have got to be joking.

78
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,033
You're ruining the image of St. Tail!

79
00:05:39,574 --> 00:05:41,132
What did you say?!

80
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:45,046
What exactly did you mean by that?

81
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,020
Exactly what it sounded like.

82
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:48,825
How rude!

83
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:56,137
And I thought I'd
get a cute shot of you.

84
00:05:56,243 --> 00:05:59,610
But I think that big piece of junk
got in the picture, too.

85
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,147
Don't refer to me as a piece of junk!

86
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:05,526
It's Sawatari, now is my chance!

87
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:09,496
Oh well.
Here, a present for you anyhow.

88
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:15,179
This is...!

89
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:20,383
"I will come to the
school festival to take Sawatari's film."

90
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:22,960
It's a challenge from St. Tail.

91
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,157
Really? You're kidding.

92
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:32,607
A big piece of junk in the way, eh?

93
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:37,525
Journalism Club

94
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,132
You're a real pest, aren't you.

95
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,637
St. Tail says she's
coming for your film...

96
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:47,177
I can protect my own stuff.

97
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:52,720
You think I'd trust the guy
who keeps letting St. Tail get away?

98
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:56,559
I'm not giving up!

99
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:06,286
You're always trying to be
the center of attention.

100
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:08,525
You're beneath my concern, Asuka.

101
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:19,373
For the time being,
I've got to hide the film someplace.

102
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:22,183
I guess the locker
should be okay for now.

103
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:29,132
Sawatari!

104
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:34,511
Hey, what are you all doing?

105
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:37,615
We'd like to have your lock.

106
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:42,289
Gee, sorry, but I only have one.

107
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,863
That's okay! We bought you some!

108
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:46,832
What?!

109
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,202
There!

110
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:50,377
Put these on his locker.

111
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:52,547
Just a moment, and...

112
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:56,189
your new locks!

113
00:07:57,965 --> 00:07:59,660
Sawatari
What is this...?!

114
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:03,399
And don't you dare take them off!

115
00:08:05,548 --> 00:08:07,175
I don't think I have a choice.

116
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:08,942
We'll come take them off later.

117
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:15,495
They shouldn't make
so many of these things!

118
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:20,673
Darn! This is stupid! Where am
I gonna hide this film?!

119
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:28,219
Asuka

120
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:31,525
Boy, Asuka sure is careless.

121
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:33,761
Wait a minute.

122
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:36,434
Maybe I'll stash the film in here.

123
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:39,947
I doubt any of the
girls would want his lock.

124
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,612
It's probably safer in here.

125
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,718
What are you doing there?!

126
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:47,430
Isn't that Asuka's locker?

127
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:51,230
I... well... it's not...

128
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:58,546
Why did you do that?!
Now it's locked!

129
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:01,753
Why did you do that?!
Now I can't get Junior's lock!

130
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:02,730
What?

131
00:09:02,968 --> 00:09:05,766
Darn. And I wanted
to dance with Asuka.

132
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:07,167
You've got to be kidding.

133
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:08,968
What did you put in there?

134
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:14,546
Oh, just something
I didn't want to get stolen.

135
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:17,120
What on earth are you talking about?

136
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:21,629
Wow. I let a girl catch me off guard.

137
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:26,079
I'm sure he was after
another of his silly stories.

138
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:28,444
Aha. So the film's...

139
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:30,748
in my locker.

140
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:37,901
What are you going to do
with the lock, anyway?

141
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:41,578
Oh, nothing in particular.

142
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:44,383
So, will you let me remove your lock?

143
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:46,023
What? Yeah, sure.

144
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:49,488
Oh, no!
You're going to give it to her!

145
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:53,269
On second thought, you can't.

146
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:55,910
Hey, why not?

147
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,277
Could it be?

148
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:02,055
I kinda forgot the combination.

149
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:05,896
Huh? Where'd they go?

150
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:26,159
Saint Paulia School Festival

151
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:48,452
The preparations took forever,
but once it got started...

152
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:49,956
time passed so quickly.

153
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:52,551
It sure did. It's almost getting dark.

154
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,428
Where's Meimi?

155
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,061
Now that you mention it, where is she?

156
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:59,198
She's goofing off somewhere.

157
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:04,850
Lord forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

158
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,134
One!

159
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:14,542
Two!

160
00:11:16,849 --> 00:11:18,043
Three!

161
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:38,252
May the blessings of God be with us!

162
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:41,924
It's getting dark. Isn't it almost time?

163
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:44,796
They said it's the real St. Tail.

164
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:46,272
You're kidding!

165
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:54,952
Eek! It's St. Tail!

166
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,424
Over there?

167
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:00,835
Sorry.

168
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:05,805
I'm not letting you get away today!

169
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:12,626
So, there you are, St. Tail!

170
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,857
What?!

171
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:20,641
We're the St. Tail trio!

172
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:24,984
St. Tail's in the 2-A classroom!

173
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:26,123
What was that?

174
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:32,368
She had a lot of nerve,
appearing in MY class.

175
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:41,321
Eek! St. Tail's
in the audiovisual room!

176
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,356
What?!

177
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,658
Darn!

178
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,534
St. Tail's in the connecting walkway!

179
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:48,866
What?!

180
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,871
Oops!

181
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:54,008
Darn you, St. Tail!

182
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:56,748
Is this where you are, Saint Tail?!

183
00:12:57,827 --> 00:13:00,762
Hurry up and Join!
One Million Saint Tails Planned.

184
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:03,494
Yes it is!

185
00:13:05,877 --> 00:13:06,809
Give me a break!

186
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:10,407
Stop dressing everyone
up like St. Tail!

187
00:13:10,954 --> 00:13:12,945
Spoilsport.

188
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,823
Every girl in school!

189
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:17,056
Hey, isn't that St. Tail?

190
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:17,933
Where?

191
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:20,094
Where's St. Tail?!

192
00:13:36,474 --> 00:13:38,465
Our decoy operation was a success.

193
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,270
Everyone's gone.

194
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:55,606
The film's mine now.

195
00:13:56,717 --> 00:13:59,447
The festival's finale will soon begin.

196
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:01,724
The festival's finale will soon begin.

197
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:03,156
All those interested in
participating please change...

198
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:05,289
and assemble on the school grounds.

199
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:07,164
I want this lock.

200
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:11,536
Sure, it's just a silly superstition,
but what if it does come true?

201
00:14:11,748 --> 00:14:12,737
Hold it right there!

202
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,976
St. Tail!

203
00:14:15,691 --> 00:14:18,319
You thought everyone was out
on the grounds, didn't you?

204
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:20,458
But you couldn't fool me!

205
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:22,128
Asuka Jr.!

206
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:23,828
Don't move!

207
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:27,209
And don't forget me,
hand over the film, you little thief!

208
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:37,631
One, two, three!

209
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:47,651
What's this?!

210
00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:52,657
Geez! Asuka, what's going on here?!

211
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:56,335
You're playing dirty, St. Tail!

212
00:15:01,186 --> 00:15:04,087
Would you mind... if I took this lock?

213
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:06,158
What the heck are you talking about?

214
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,030
Take it for all I care, just
come out and fight fair and square!

215
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:12,835
Thanks.

216
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:30,405
Let's see, the east side is...

217
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:40,023
Perfect!

218
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:41,594
St. Tail!

219
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:44,541
Now you'll get yours!

220
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,610
It's St. Tail!

221
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:47,812
Where?

222
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:49,476
Over there!

223
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:59,230
It's the real thing!

224
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:00,701
You're kidding, really?

225
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:04,048
I'm trapped!

226
00:16:04,452 --> 00:16:06,750
There's nowhere to go!

227
00:16:06,857 --> 00:16:08,518
Give me back my film!

228
00:16:18,882 --> 00:16:21,043
Ladies and gentlemen!

229
00:16:21,254 --> 00:16:23,245
Please forgive this commotion!

230
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:28,494
What is that?

231
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:29,592
A balloon?

232
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:32,102
Someone's floating up there.

233
00:16:32,244 --> 00:16:33,836
And in a bag, no less.

234
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:36,007
It's Junior-in-a-bag. And...

235
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:37,651
Sawatari-in-a-bag!

236
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:43,821
You idiots!

237
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:46,560
Don't just stand there like dummies!

238
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,870
St. Tail, put us down!

239
00:16:49,045 --> 00:16:51,775
One, two, three!

240
00:16:53,488 --> 00:16:55,547
St. Tail disappeared!

241
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:04,737
Junior and Sawatari have also...

242
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,068
disappeared.

243
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:15,434
I return this to you.

244
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,458
Oh, the film!

245
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:19,667
Thank you very much.

246
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:24,074
We did it.

247
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,987
Wow!

248
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:32,659
Asuka!

249
00:17:32,904 --> 00:17:34,394
How'd you do that?

250
00:17:36,044 --> 00:17:37,602
Uh, she did it again.

251
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:40,984
Miss Haneoka.

252
00:17:42,491 --> 00:17:43,219
Are you alone?

253
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:44,456
Yes...

254
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:48,054
Will you dance with me?
It's no fun dancing by yourself.

255
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:50,329
I... um... no, thank you.

256
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:52,666
But why not? Come on, let's go.

257
00:17:52,912 --> 00:17:54,470
But, I...

258
00:17:55,251 --> 00:17:58,687
What'll I do?
I was going to ask Asuka Jr.

259
00:17:58,792 --> 00:17:59,224
Hold it!

260
00:18:02,098 --> 00:18:03,087
I said hold it!

261
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:07,332
Ouch!

262
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:12,283
Hey! What's going on here?

263
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:17,383
I... but... it hurts,
you don't have to pull so hard!

264
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:19,664
You'd better explain that!

265
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:23,102
You're always whacking
me with a broom...

266
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:25,507
so why couldn't you tell
him to back off there?

267
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:29,013
If you didn't want to go,
you should have made it clear!

268
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:30,919
I know.

269
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:46,446
Oh, you don't hate me, do you?

270
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:49,384
The charm...

271
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,323
it actually worked!

272
00:19:10,174 --> 00:19:16,443
Rats! Darn that St. Tail!
I'll make you pay for this!

273
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:20,193
Ouch!
