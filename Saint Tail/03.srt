1
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:07,958
By day she is a happy student
at St. Paulia School.

2
00:00:08,807 --> 00:00:11,571
But at night, she becomes
the phantom thief Saint Tail...

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,914
to do good deeds for all who come
asking for help from Seira...

4
00:00:13,992 --> 00:00:15,482
a nun in training.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,796
Looking to capture the elusive Saint Tail
is an amateur detective...

6
00:00:20,882 --> 00:00:22,850
and Meimi's classmate, Asuka Jr.

7
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:25,053
As for Meimi...

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,531
she may have more than a bit of
interest in such a determined boy.

9
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:33,848
Meimi's lover is a hedgehog?!

10
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:43,718
That mom of mine!

11
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:46,491
It's Sunday, and she has to make me
go do the grocery shopping.

12
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:04,356
Hey, hold it there!

13
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:21,313
What is it?! What's so funny?!

14
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:25,460
You're a really rude creature!

15
00:01:25,776 --> 00:01:26,470
Humph!

16
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,658
I'm leaving!

17
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,547
Hey, wait!

18
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:58,540
If it's the cat, it went that way.

19
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,588
Thanks!

20
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:02,924
Oh, please watch the shop
for a moment!

21
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:04,867
What? Hang on a second!

22
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:06,104
Stop!

23
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,956
Good grief!

24
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,506
What could this be?

25
00:02:28,594 --> 00:02:29,288
Y... You!

26
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,098
You're the rude one
I met the other day.

27
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:34,808
Humph!

28
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:46,686
I see.

29
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:50,831
You're all alone, aren't you?

30
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:56,615
Cheer up, cute little hedgehog.

31
00:03:02,513 --> 00:03:06,210
You're the only person that this
hedgehog has warmed up to.

32
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:08,354
Really.

33
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:12,969
My name is Meimi Haneoka.

34
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,779
I'll come to see you ever day from
now on! So let's be friends.

35
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,260
So cute!

36
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,304
Oh, no! I'll be late for school!

37
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:24,411
Oh, no! Not again!

38
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,787
Hey, hold it!
Come back!

39
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:27,488
Don't run away!

40
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:33,616
Meimi, want to stop for
ice cream on the way home?

41
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:37,225
There's a new shop that just opened
beside the park on 2nd Avenue.

42
00:03:38,036 --> 00:03:40,436
Sorry, I've got something to do today.

43
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,501
Something to do?

44
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:43,177
A date.

45
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,352
What?!

46
00:03:44,693 --> 00:03:46,126
Yup! See you!

47
00:03:51,116 --> 00:03:52,515
A date?!

48
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:54,654
Good afternoon.

49
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,496
Have you had a nice day?

50
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:03,451
Hi! Back again?
You're fond of her, aren't you?

51
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:05,452
She's so cute!

52
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:11,028
Why don't you ask your mother and
father if you can buy her as a pet?

53
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:14,845
I promise I won't sell her to anyone
else until you get their permission.

54
00:04:14,932 --> 00:04:15,626
Really?

55
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:18,169
You won't sell her
to anyone else until then?

56
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:20,676
Sure. I promise.

57
00:04:21,187 --> 00:04:22,552
Great!

58
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,090
Wait for me, my little hedgehog.

59
00:04:27,075 --> 00:04:28,099
Mister, I'll be back!

60
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:29,237
All right, see you!

61
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:34,225
Hey!

62
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:35,693
Yes?

63
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,309
This hedgehog, sell him to me.

64
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:42,054
But it's already...

65
00:04:44,302 --> 00:04:47,328
Look, I said I want this hedgehog!

66
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:54,959
Please Dad, can I?
Can I have the hedgehog?

67
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:58,212
Did you say hedgehog?

68
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:01,049
That's right.
I even have a name for her.

69
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:03,663
I'll call her Ruby.

70
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,203
Ruby?

71
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:08,944
The ring that dad bought you
is a ruby, right?

72
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:10,885
Yes, my engagement ring.

73
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:12,724
That's why I named her that.

74
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,911
Hmm... a ruby...

75
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:26,573
It does bring back memories
of the old days, doesn't it, dear?

76
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,150
It sure does.

77
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,589
Eimi, you haven't changed
a bit since then.

78
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:35,070
Why, dear, you haven't either.

79
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:37,045
Eimi...

80
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:39,288
Genichiro...

81
00:05:40,564 --> 00:05:42,361
Hello, you two?

82
00:05:42,638 --> 00:05:45,072
Oh, gee, Meimi, were you there?

83
00:05:45,683 --> 00:05:47,947
Of course, where else would I be?

84
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:51,088
Then it's all right for me to have
a hedgehog named Ruby?

85
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:52,528
Sure.

86
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:53,833
Phew...

87
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:57,585
It helps, having easy-going parents.

88
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:02,804
Good afternoon!

89
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:04,105
What?!

90
00:06:05,351 --> 00:06:06,841
I'm really sorry...

91
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,957
You promised you wouldn't sell her!

92
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:13,629
He insisted on buying it.
He wouldn't take no for an answer.

93
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:16,885
I'm really sorry.

94
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:30,332
Moping will get me nowhere.

95
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:34,439
I'm sure Ruby is having
a nice life, too.

96
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,247
Right! I'm sure of it!

97
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,713
"Polar Tear?"

98
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:46,422
Yes, it's a beautiful diamond.

99
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:50,529
Legend says it's a teardrop
of the North Star.

100
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:55,439
I shared the diamond with Hayase,
an old friend from my school days.

101
00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:01,098
We took turns, keeping the gem
for two months at a time.

102
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:05,011
That was our agreement.
I never expected he would betray me.

103
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:06,827
He betrayed you?

104
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:08,193
Yes.

105
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:13,006
Yesterday was the day I was to receive
the diamond for the next two months.

106
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:19,362
Hayase, what are you saying?
You haven't given the diamond to me!

107
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:24,207
That's ridiculous, Kamimura.
Of course I gave you the diamond.

108
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:29,897
If you doubt me, search the house!

109
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:34,582
Kamimura... maybe...

110
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:40,831
You're not trying to keep the
diamond all to yourself, right?

111
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:42,283
What?

112
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,649
That's what you're trying to do!

113
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,090
Cut it out.

114
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:49,333
Do you have any proof that
I didn't give you the diamond?

115
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:05,626
That's the story I heard today.

116
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:09,142
They finally called the police
and searched the house, but...

117
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,115
They couldn't find the diamond.

118
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:16,655
And according to the contract,
if the Polar Tear is lost...

119
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:20,611
the one that loses the gem
has to pay for it.

120
00:08:21,192 --> 00:08:22,090
Then...

121
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,802
On top of stealing the diamond...

122
00:08:25,976 --> 00:08:31,437
Hayase is holding him
liable for the cost.

123
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:38,102
I'm really angry! Phantom Saint Tail
shall retrieve that diamond!

124
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:44,420
Is something wrong?
You're not usually this touchy.

125
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:47,010
Seira!

126
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:48,447
What happened?

127
00:08:48,956 --> 00:08:50,355
I went to the pet shop.

128
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:52,195
The pet shop?

129
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:55,799
Someone bought my hedgehog!
She's gone!

130
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:59,915
I'd even thought up some hedgehog
magic to use on the next caper!

131
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:02,086
What's that supposed to be?

132
00:09:27,122 --> 00:09:29,556
Well then, let us continue
from line 20.

133
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,909
Mr. Asuka! Read!

134
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:47,450
Yes.

135
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:50,762
Let's see.

136
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:56,939
"Tonight, I'll be at the Hayase
mansion to get the Polar Tear"

137
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:58,654
"Signed, Saint Tail."

138
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:11,870
What is this?!

139
00:10:12,748 --> 00:10:14,841
That's my line!

140
00:10:16,461 --> 00:10:17,393
Idiot.

141
00:10:23,786 --> 00:10:26,846
My Lord, forgive me, for I use
no gimmick or trick.

142
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:32,874
One!

143
00:10:35,861 --> 00:10:36,725
Two!

144
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,166
Three!

145
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:59,901
May the blessings of God be with us!

146
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:02,980
Meimi, do your best!

147
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:04,454
I will.

148
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,428
To help me forget
my little hedgehog...

149
00:11:07,573 --> 00:11:09,473
I'm gonna nail this guy!

150
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,813
I don't need your security!

151
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,389
The police checked it out, but
the Polar Tear is not in this mansion.

152
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,369
Whatever Saint Tail
is supposed to be...

153
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:22,942
how can she steal something
that isn't here?

154
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:28,291
But Saint Tail sent me a warning
that she'll show up here.

155
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:33,823
That's...

156
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,424
The Mayor's special
badge of investigation.

157
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:39,107
I'm staking out
your home, Mr. Hayase.

158
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:51,779
The question is where's the diamond?

159
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:54,963
That must be Hayase.

160
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:02,123
That's...

161
00:12:02,798 --> 00:12:05,824
But why is my
hedgehog Ruby here?

162
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:10,413
I must say, this is ingenious.

163
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,928
No one would ever think that the
Polar Tear is inside your stomach!

164
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,741
What a terrible thing to do!
Absolutely unforgivable!

165
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:22,224
Come in.

166
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:24,033
Oh, it's you.

167
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:27,175
It's rude of me,
but are you really sure...

168
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,912
the Polar Tear is
not in the mansion?

169
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:32,462
Persistent, aren't you?

170
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:35,037
I told you, I handed the diamond
over to Kamimura.

171
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:38,015
Wow!

172
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:41,356
A hedgehog?
What an unusual pet.

173
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:42,793
Don't touch it!

174
00:12:49,327 --> 00:12:50,385
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:51,021
Stop!

176
00:13:00,065 --> 00:13:01,498
It's Saint Tail!

177
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:09,487
Darn, you're not getting away!

178
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:12,230
My Polar Tear!

179
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,844
Hang on tight!

180
00:13:16,924 --> 00:13:17,822
Hold it!

181
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:21,731
They sure are persistent!

182
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:28,385
Look out!

183
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:36,347
Ouch!

184
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:41,697
What the... why are you on my head?

185
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:44,510
Don't move!

186
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:48,329
Wait!

187
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:50,664
What are you chasing me for?!

188
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,539
Shut up! Stop running away!

189
00:13:55,726 --> 00:13:57,523
Asuka Jr.! I'm over here!

190
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,872
I won't let you get away!

191
00:14:01,947 --> 00:14:05,007
You brat!
Why are you running away!

192
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,855
I'm not running away,
I'm chasing Saint Tail!

193
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:17,588
Where are you? Saint Tail!

194
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:18,897
Asuka Jr.!

195
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:22,878
Hand over that hedgehog!

196
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:26,822
You just wait right there!
I'll get you for sure!

197
00:14:29,845 --> 00:14:30,937
Hold it!

198
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:33,216
How hopeless can he be?

199
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:44,290
There she is!

200
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:50,139
It's showtime!

201
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,827
You little pest! Hand it over!

202
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:17,637
Hold that elevator!

203
00:15:18,315 --> 00:15:19,179
Shoot!

204
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,736
It's no use trying
to escape like that!

205
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:31,284
I'll catch up to you
in the other elevator!

206
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:34,293
Wait!

207
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:34,996
What?!

208
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:38,543
What are you planning to do to her?!

209
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:42,477
Shut up! The hedgehog is all...

210
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:55,058
Look this way, Saint Tail.
Maybe I can see her face.

211
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:57,412
I just want to get
a look at her face.

212
00:15:57,484 --> 00:15:58,610
Show your face!

213
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,082
How...

214
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,819
is...

215
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:02,124
this?!

216
00:16:06,851 --> 00:16:09,581
I'll be getting off here. Bye bye!

217
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:13,293
Hey! Stop! Stop!

218
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,170
Do something, you brat!

219
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:17,477
Shut up! Stop being a pain!

220
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:21,991
Too bad that elevator doesn't stop
until it gets to the top!

221
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:31,190
Wait right there!
I'll get you for sure!

222
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,308
I know I should probably
just escape now.

223
00:16:36,588 --> 00:16:37,350
Right?

224
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:44,596
It really bugs me.
Why can't I just let that guy be?

225
00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:52,432
Wait, it's coming up?

226
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:56,976
What a stupid phantom,
she's going to follow us up here!

227
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,131
Here it comes!

228
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:04,503
Saint Tail, we've got you!

229
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,482
Hand over my hedgehog!

230
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:13,139
What?!

231
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,189
I didn't think I'd get a chance
to use my hedgehog magic so soon!

232
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,338
Saint Tail?

233
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:24,047
One! Two!

234
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:25,815
Three!

235
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:43,817
Oh, you were able to cough it up!

236
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:45,115
I'm so glad!

237
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,193
That's what you get for being bad
and hoarding the gem all to yourself!

238
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:52,541
Ouch!

239
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:57,058
Wait!

240
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,046
Wait!

241
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:04,448
Goodbye!

242
00:18:04,762 --> 00:18:06,491
Take care of the rest for me!

243
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,139
A star?

244
00:18:21,654 --> 00:18:23,781
Oh, it's the Polar Tear.

245
00:18:23,862 --> 00:18:24,487
Hey!

246
00:18:24,597 --> 00:18:27,065
Why did she give this to me?

247
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,232
Hey, son!

248
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:30,411
Dad!

249
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:33,578
Hayase is out cold down there.

250
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:36,257
But I'm arresting him
on charges offraud.

251
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:40,409
And this is Mr. Kamimura,
the owner of the diamond.

252
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:42,419
I'm so glad...

253
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:45,999
the Polar Tear is safe,
thank you so much!

254
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:47,301
Ah... don't mention it.

255
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:51,613
Saint Tail, she...

256
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:59,370
Well now, Hayase has been caught.
Wanna come live at my house?

257
00:19:02,597 --> 00:19:05,430
Okay! One, two, three!

258
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,218
This is to celebrate our friendship!

259
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,825
Let's be good friends!
