1
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:09,230
Too bad about that contest,
huh, Meimi?

2
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:14,378
Yeah, and Rina too, but I heard
you did pretty good. Right, Asuka Jr.?

3
00:00:14,987 --> 00:00:20,357
They both didn't make it.
That means they weren't good enough.

4
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:24,870
You're right, it was stupid...

5
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,943
...of you to let St. Tail get away
when you had her trapped.

6
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:31,685
Why, you! Back then--

7
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:33,824
-Back then what?
-Back then--

8
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:38,193
I just remembered. I have things
to do. I'll see you later!

9
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,669
Me too!

10
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:43,680
Back then, I...

11
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,885
Meimi, don't rub it in.
He's really hurt.

12
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:52,124
I don't know what got
into me that night.

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,059
Asuka Jr., I swear
I'll get you to notice me.

14
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:13,071
THE MAYOR'S AMBITION!
STEALING A SWAN (PART 1)

15
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:18,548
Excuse me, Mayor Morinaka.

16
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:21,492
The sculpture from Sakuraoka
has arrived.

17
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:25,435
Thank you.
Have them bring it up here.

18
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:27,735
What sculpture, Uncle?

19
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:32,713
Rina, you've heard of Ichiro Kanoh,
haven't you?

20
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,719
Yes, the renowned sculptor?

21
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,860
Thank you.

22
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:41,199
Is this one of his sculptures?

23
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:46,674
This is The Swan,
one of his first pieces.

24
00:01:46,922 --> 00:01:50,619
Wow, it's beautiful.
It's crystal, isn't it?

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,362
It belongs to the city of Sakuraoka...

26
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:57,837
...but the mayor's lent it
to us for a month.

27
00:01:58,448 --> 00:02:03,283
I want our citizens to see this,
so I'm displaying it at the museum.

28
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:05,050
It looks expensive.

29
00:02:05,596 --> 00:02:09,555
By the way, Rina, what did you
want to see me about?

30
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:15,078
What's wrong?

31
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,125
It's about Asuka Jr.!

32
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:27,303
Asuka Jr. You've been fond of him
from the time you moved to this city.

33
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:31,003
-What about him?
-Asuka Jr. ...

34
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:34,981
He has no intention
of arresting St. Tail!

35
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:37,263
What do you mean by that?

36
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:43,429
I saw him. He had her trapped
the other night...

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,513
...but he let go of her hand!

38
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,730
He let her go!

39
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,778
You're sure about that?

40
00:03:00,017 --> 00:03:02,781
Letting him remain on the case
is a waste of time.

41
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:07,926
You must take him off
all of St. Tail's investigations.

42
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:13,640
I understand. Let me think about it.

43
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:16,643
Yes, Uncle. You know what's best.

44
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:23,161
Has The Swan reached Seika City?

45
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:26,734
Yes, we just confirmed it
with Mayor Morinaka.

46
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:28,603
Good work.

47
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:33,008
I guess you could say
the stage is set.

48
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:35,588
Yabe, when did you get here?

49
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:40,732
Mr. Okajima, you are truly
a corrupt mayor.

50
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:45,535
You lend the crystal to Seika, then
have it stolen and fill your pocket.

51
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:49,416
Just call me smart.

52
00:03:50,962 --> 00:03:57,367
That's why I hired an experienced
thief like you to help me.

53
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,310
I'm aware of that.
If it's stolen from Seika...

54
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:07,082
...the responsibility's not yours,
and you get the crystal.

55
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,029
On top of that, Seika has to pay you
a lot in compensation, don't they?

56
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,344
Never mind. How are
your preparations going?

57
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:18,244
Don't worry.
Everything's taken care of.

58
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:22,818
Do a good job getting it.
I'm counting on you.

59
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:27,463
Good morning, Meimi!

60
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,973
Ryoko, Kyoko, good morning!

61
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:34,045
Did you read the newspaper?
I was absolutely shocked!

62
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:40,418
"Tomorrow evening, I'll go to the art
museum to steal The Swan. -St. Tail"

63
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,731
-She's being very bold this time.
-She sure is.

64
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:49,377
What's going on?
I didn't make this announcement.

65
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,889
What are you gonna do?
She's making a big deal.

66
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:55,964
-It's obvious--
-Obvious she'll get away with it?

67
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:59,072
Shut up! I'm not letting her
get away purposely!

68
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:00,438
Sorry.

69
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:05,349
If you keep letting her get away,
the mayor will lose patience.

70
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:07,617
I know! This time for sure--

71
00:05:07,864 --> 00:05:11,265
This time she's not getting away!
We hope.

72
00:05:11,505 --> 00:05:14,372
You guys aren't human!
I'm gonna kill you!

73
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:16,910
Oh, save us!

74
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:21,420
Chase her to your heart's content
for the time being, Asuka Jr.

75
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:25,931
Because very soon now
you'll never be able to.

76
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:39,220
My, so you came here
all the way from Sakuraoka?

77
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:43,297
Yes, because I heard The Swan
was here in Seika.

78
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:46,602
-So you came here to see it?
- No, I...

79
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,350
Is something the matter?

80
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:52,524
I know the truth!

81
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:57,325
St. Tail's announcement in today's
paper is a fake! It's a lie.

82
00:05:57,573 --> 00:06:00,337
Calm down. Who are you, anyway?

83
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:05,785
I'm a maid. I work for
Mr. Okajima, Sakuraoka's mayor.

84
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:10,985
I heard the mayor
and another man plotting something.

85
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:17,772
After I steal it, you'd better sell it
overseas before they trace it to us.

86
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:21,351
I'll do that.
You'll help me, won't you?

87
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:23,727
You can count on it.

88
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:28,128
I thought of going
right to the police...

89
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:30,706
...but I'm a live-in maid.

90
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:34,974
If I were to lose my job,
I'd have nowhere to go.

91
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:37,919
And so you came here.

92
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:43,296
Forgive me.
I just had to talk to someone!

93
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,032
It's all right.

94
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:51,151
Don't worry.
I'm sure the Lord will guide you.

95
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,075
What did that article
in this morning's paper mean?

96
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,622
Seira says she didn't know about it,
and I didn't do it. Could it be a fake?

97
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:15,843
Dad!

98
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:19,079
Can I come in?

99
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:24,013
What were you doing? Is this
another experiment in suspension?

100
00:07:24,263 --> 00:07:29,428
The last one was a failure.
But now this time, watch.

101
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:35,946
-See?
-Wow!

102
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,488
-How did you do that?
-I'm glad you asked.

103
00:07:52,726 --> 00:07:55,718
When you push
the switch on my wrist...

104
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:59,925
...the motor on my hip extends
and retracts the wire.

105
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:03,641
Wow, it's fantastic!

106
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:07,153
And it can even do this.

107
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:14,631
Instant transit.
Look how fast I go!

108
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:21,481
That's great.

109
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:24,423
And you can do something like--

110
00:08:24,663 --> 00:08:26,756
Meimi, dinner's ready.

111
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,937
Why, Dad, I thought you were outside.

112
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:33,206
He came in through the window.

113
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:36,281
What were you thinking,
sneaking into her room?

114
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:37,989
You see, I...

115
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,922
Did you say dinner? Let's eat.

116
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,492
How childish!

117
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:51,945
Then that announcement...

118
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:57,355
Yes. I'm sure Mayor Okajima told
that Mr. Yabe to have it printed.

119
00:08:57,903 --> 00:09:00,531
They want St. Tail to get blamed.

120
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:03,801
What terrible people!
They won't get away with this!

121
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:09,043
Is there some way we can get The Swan
before that Yabe steals it?

122
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:13,526
Of course there is! I'm going
to the museum tomorrow night too!

123
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:21,781
Have you finished
setting up the display?

124
00:09:23,058 --> 00:09:25,492
-Mr. Mayor.
-Yes, we're almost finished.

125
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:31,468
Because it's a crystal swan,
we put it in the setting of a lake.

126
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:37,415
Asuka Jr. suggested we put a lake
around it so no one can get too close.

127
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,515
Naturally, security will
be very tight.

128
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:45,166
I intend to spend the night in
the space between the case and lake.

129
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:48,706
You personally?
Can't we use a security camera?

130
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:52,884
Well, machinery can be reprogrammed.

131
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:58,027
She's not getting away this time.
I intend to capture her myself!

132
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,106
He has no intention
of arresting St. Tail!

133
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:06,372
Is there something wrong?

134
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:13,753
Since I already announced yesterday
about the exhibit, I can't cancel it.

135
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:17,268
I'm counting on you.
Don't let me down!

136
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:19,604
I won't!

137
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:47,235
Asuka Jr., I believe in you.

138
00:10:57,665 --> 00:11:03,661
Asuka Jr., it's your own fault,
not mine.

139
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:15,425
All right, men, it's almost time,
so please take your positions.

140
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:17,105
Yes, sir!

141
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:33,537
I'm ready for you, St. Tail.
Tonight's the night.

142
00:11:38,121 --> 00:11:42,023
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

143
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,638
One!

144
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:52,178
Two!

145
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:56,419
Three!

146
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:14,223
Ruby, you rascal, you followed me.

147
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:20,502
Tonight is important.
My reputation is at stake.

148
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:26,320
Meimi, I'll take care of Ruby.

149
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:28,358
Come on, Ruby.

150
00:12:28,598 --> 00:12:30,156
Thank you, Seira.

151
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:36,935
I'll keep The Swan until Yabe is
arrested, then return it to the museum.

152
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:38,579
Be careful.

153
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,595
May the blessings of God be with us.

154
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,650
St. Tail, I'm ready for you.

155
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:03,534
Just touch this case and I'll nab you.

156
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:07,973
That's right. I'll have no problem
if I catch you in the act.

157
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,242
I need you to take a little nap.

158
00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:06,768
So that's it.
Good, Yabe's not here yet.

159
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:44,254
-She's here!
-Where?

160
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:49,161
Wait, take it easy.
You've got to catch her in the act!

161
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:52,343
It's St. Tail!

162
00:14:57,258 --> 00:14:59,089
It's...

163
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:02,660
...Show...

164
00:15:04,074 --> 00:15:06,338
...Time!

165
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:26,272
They're all asleep.
I've got to hurry.

166
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,282
What a fitting display.

167
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:33,057
She's here! It's St. Tail!

168
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:37,810
I got her!

169
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:41,745
You're not taking that, St. Tail!

170
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,754
So this is where he was!

171
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:50,734
Don't fight it! Give up!

172
00:15:57,725 --> 00:16:00,922
You're not getting away, St. Tail.

173
00:16:09,183 --> 00:16:10,673
Oh, no!

174
00:16:17,234 --> 00:16:19,395
Rats! She's a decoy!

175
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:24,108
Asuka Jr.!

176
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:28,185
Ow, my leg.

177
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:30,827
Oh, no!

178
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:40,013
What happened? Oh, my God!

179
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:44,251
-The sculpture's been stolen!
-What'd you say?

180
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:46,655
Where's Asuka Jr.?

181
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:48,958
Asuka Jr.

182
00:16:57,957 --> 00:17:01,552
Aw, shoot! Where'd he go?

183
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:13,783
Hold it! Rats!

184
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,091
That's a straight road! Yes!

185
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:27,374
I'm not letting her
get away this time!

186
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:58,249
You're not getting away!

187
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,567
What was that?

188
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:25,635
That's funny.
I didn't think St. Tail used cars.

189
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:32,585
Thank you, St. Tail! Who'd have
thought it'd go so smoothly?

190
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:35,330
That fake ad in the paper
did the trick!

191
00:18:35,571 --> 00:18:36,868
What'd he say?

192
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,318
I finally made it up here.

193
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:52,526
Asuka Jr., I never thought
it'd turn out this way.

194
00:18:54,278 --> 00:18:58,078
Asuka Jr., be careful.

195
00:18:59,691 --> 00:19:01,784
Come back safely.

196
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:14,150
Asuka Jr., come back safely!
