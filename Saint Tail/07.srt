1
00:00:03,869 --> 00:00:06,463
There's this boy I'd like to meet,
named Asuka Jr.

2
00:00:07,477 --> 00:00:09,308
Is he in this school?

3
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:17,553
A First Rendezvous of Tears?!

4
00:00:23,777 --> 00:00:25,972
I've finally found you!
Asuka Jr.!

5
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,188
All right!

6
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:33,683
H... hey, what are you doing here?!

7
00:00:33,964 --> 00:00:36,023
I looked all over town for you!

8
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,095
But what are you doing here?!

9
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,938
It took so long to find you!

10
00:00:42,582 --> 00:00:46,040
I guess I couldn't find you,
since you're so small.

11
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:49,386
Answer my question,
before this turns into a fight!

12
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:52,590
Meimi, who is she?

13
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:53,997
She's a new student!

14
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:56,073
I'll tell you about her later!

15
00:00:57,212 --> 00:01:00,579
I guess she doesn't need me
to take care of her!

16
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:02,413
Some nerve!

17
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:04,255
Humph!

18
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,300
Cute... cute...

19
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,665
Knock it off!

20
00:01:10,772 --> 00:01:12,330
Relax. It's nothing.

21
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:14,873
What is with her?

22
00:01:19,223 --> 00:01:21,714
"Rina Takamiya"
I'm Rina Takamiya,
a new student.

23
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:22,954
Nice to meet you.

24
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:29,570
Asuka, why don't you show me around?

25
00:01:29,711 --> 00:01:30,803
Why me?

26
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:34,405
Why not?! You should be
nice to new students.

27
00:01:34,588 --> 00:01:36,852
She's cool, I like tall girls.

28
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:38,720
She doesn't look 14.

29
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:40,689
She's got a nice figure.

30
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,730
Maybe she's a model, right?

31
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:46,233
Stop! You over there!
Don't go making assumptions!

32
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:47,676
She heard us.

33
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:53,277
When I grow up, I'm going to
become a police officer!

34
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:55,526
A police officer?

35
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,861
That's right.
I'm going to catch bad guys.

36
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:04,534
Especially that sneaky thief,
St. Tail.

37
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:06,884
I'm going to arrest her with
my bare hands.

38
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:10,619
Wait a minute!

39
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:12,987
I'm the one who's going
to arrest her!

40
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:16,867
Well, Ms. Takamiya, Asuka Jr. was
appointed by the mayor...

41
00:02:17,074 --> 00:02:20,066
to investigate St. Tail.

42
00:02:22,084 --> 00:02:24,245
Well, the Mayor happens
to be my Uncle.

43
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:28,258
The Mayor's Niece.

44
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,932
That's right?
Is... that... right?

45
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,709
Then I'll go right over and ask
my Uncle for permission!

46
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,114
There's nothing to worry about.

47
00:02:39,153 --> 00:02:41,917
St. Tail won't be captured
that easily.

48
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:44,058
Meimi?

49
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,893
Poor thing, you're trembling.

50
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:48,868
What's with her,
sticking so close to him!

51
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:51,805
Humph! Suit yourselves!

52
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:52,840
What?

53
00:02:58,192 --> 00:02:59,659
Ancient Hidden Treasures Exhibition?

54
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:03,787
Yes, it's being held now
at the Central Hall.

55
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:04,934
The problem is...

56
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:08,035
The "Dagger of Yatto"
that's on display...

57
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:10,138
is not what it seems to be.

58
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:12,544
It's not a hidden treasure!

59
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:14,019
What?

60
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:16,083
What do you mean?

61
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,992
The dagger is a copy
that I made.

62
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:21,130
It's a replica!

63
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,968
Replica... you mean it's a fake?

64
00:03:25,548 --> 00:03:28,745
I usually work as a sculptor...

65
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:33,051
But one day, I was asked by the man
in charge of Central Hall, Mr. Mizutani...

66
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:36,795
to make a replica of the
Dagger of Yatto.

67
00:03:37,872 --> 00:03:42,036
I made it because he promised me that
he was only going to use it as...

68
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:45,583
a decoration in his house,
just to enjoy.

69
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:49,183
I never thought he would exhibit it
as the real Dagger of Yatto!

70
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:52,661
If I report it to the police,
I'll probably be arrested, too!

71
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:58,439
I can't sleep at night because I think
about everybody I'm deceiving.

72
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:00,879
What should I do?

73
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:09,398
The Lord will surely forgive you.

74
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:12,563
After all, you've confessed
and repented.

75
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:14,705
Sister...

76
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,477
Don't worry. I'm sure the Lord
will guide you.

77
00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:28,840
So that's the story, Meimi.

78
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:30,535
Leave it to me!

79
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:33,313
I don't know much about
ancient relics...

80
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,315
whether it's Jomon period earthenware,
a burial mound figure, or a clay doll...

81
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,521
you can count on
St. Tail to recover it!

82
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:41,191
Meimi...

83
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:43,002
it's a dagger.

84
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,940
I've got an idea of how things are
between you and Ms. Takamiya...

85
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:49,284
but try to stay calm.

86
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,122
I'll show her!

87
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,071
I'm home!

88
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:06,651
Welcome back.

89
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:10,951
Meimi, I'm quite sure my magic
trick will work this time.

90
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:12,658
Want to see it?

91
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:18,132
Not right now. But, could I
borrow one of your magic tricks?

92
00:05:19,313 --> 00:05:20,974
One of my magic tricks?

93
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:31,933
I'm going to send him a warning
that will blow his mind.

94
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:38,377
Asuka!
Can I eat lunch with you?

95
00:05:39,788 --> 00:05:44,054
No way!
Girls always want to trade snacks.

96
00:05:44,397 --> 00:05:46,365
I'm not interested in doing that.

97
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:51,243
What's this...

98
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,251
"I'm going to Central Hall tonight
to get the Dagger of Yatto..."

99
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,622
"St. Tail"

100
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:03,560
For a thief, she sure does send
lovely warnings.

101
00:06:03,871 --> 00:06:04,929
Doesn't she Asuka?

102
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:06,201
Idiot!

103
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:07,367
What was that noise?

104
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:08,343
What's up?

105
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:13,512
It's a warning from St. Tail!

106
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:14,421
What?!

107
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:16,151
Let me taste some, too.

108
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,965
Hey don't eat it!
It's my lunch!

109
00:06:20,438 --> 00:06:23,168
What are you talking about?
Don't hog it all.

110
00:06:23,244 --> 00:06:25,678
-Hey don't eat my hand!
-Let go!!
What is with them?

111
00:06:26,884 --> 00:06:28,215
Your chopsticks broke.

112
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,083
Yes, it seems so.

113
00:06:38,575 --> 00:06:41,135
I've been waiting for you, Asuka Jr.

114
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:44,578
My name is Mizutani and I'm the
one in charge of this exhibition.

115
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:46,879
Nice to meet you.

116
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:49,124
The pleasure is mine, Asuka Jr.

117
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:51,761
Let's get down to business.
May I see the Dagger of Yatto?

118
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:52,562
Please follow me.

119
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,948
It's almost like a movie set.
All this justfor the exhibition?

120
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:10,900
Yes, I even have a special exhibition
room just for the Dagger of Yatto.

121
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,436
This way please.

122
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:22,582
It's inside this pyramid set.
We've set up a room in here.

123
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,266
If the dagger is stolen and
there's an investigation...

124
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:46,138
The cameras are on 24 hours a day.

125
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,571
Asuka Jr. ...

126
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:52,781
Are there any particular orders
you have for the guards on duty?

127
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:56,889
Shall we guard it
from inside the room?

128
00:07:57,302 --> 00:08:00,635
No... just guard the entrance
of the exhibition hall.

129
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,304
But...

130
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:09,252
I'll hide inside that Sarcophagus,
if it's ok with you?

131
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,724
Huh? Oh, yes.

132
00:08:11,464 --> 00:08:16,902
St. Tail usually appears from above.
So this should give me a good view.

133
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:20,804
We'll make her think this place
is not heavily guarded.

134
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,910
When she comes in here...

135
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:26,288
I'll catch her in the act and
arrest her!

136
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:29,997
This set is perfect.

137
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:32,599
The place is narrow, so I'll get
her for sure this time!

138
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:34,636
Not clever enough, Asuka Jr.

139
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:36,905
Takamiya?!

140
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,817
You've got to trap her
more aggressively.

141
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:44,958
It's none of your business!

142
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:46,757
You're bothering me,
so go on home!

143
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:49,971
Hmm... You really mean that?

144
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,908
Wh... what?!!

145
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:55,383
"To Askua Jr. ..."

146
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,253
"Please look after my niece, Rina.
I'm sure she'll be able to help you."

147
00:08:58,293 --> 00:09:00,193
"Please let her assist you."

148
00:09:00,731 --> 00:09:02,824
Mayor Hideo Morinaka"

149
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:11,739
I'll be in the surveillance room,
watching for your strategy to fail.

150
00:09:13,757 --> 00:09:14,621
Darn...!

151
00:09:14,726 --> 00:09:19,356
But with my strategy, tonight will be
the last night for St. Tail.

152
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,101
Who said that you could...

153
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:22,869
Read... Read...

154
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:57,505
Forgive me, for I use
no gimmick or trick.

155
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:04,051
One!

156
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:07,423
Two!

157
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:11,269
Three!

158
00:10:34,122 --> 00:10:35,521
Be careful...

159
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,388
Especially for Ms. Takamiya.

160
00:10:41,604 --> 00:10:44,937
May the blessings of God be with us.

161
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:57,855
I won't lose tonight's fight.
They will see my victory.

162
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,371
They're only guarding the entrance.

163
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:24,748
That's pretty lenient, considering
they're up against St. Tail.

164
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:32,196
There.

165
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,183
So that's the Dagger of Yatto.

166
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,296
It's...

167
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:49,099
Show Time!

168
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:57,381
Rina, the security camera!!

169
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,424
What did you say!!

170
00:12:03,604 --> 00:12:05,936
How could this happen at
such a critical moment?!

171
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:08,000
Please Stand By.

172
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:15,984
She's here...
St. Tail.

173
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:22,402
That's right, as soon as you touch
that case, you're finished!

174
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:29,387
Wait a moment, Rina!

175
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,789
She's got to be kidding,
not taking us seriously!

176
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:34,695
I can't count on Asuka's strategy!

177
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:39,969
Set target: Inside the pyramid!

178
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,655
Now!

179
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:49,662
That's as far as you go, St. Tail!

180
00:12:56,178 --> 00:12:59,409
Asuka, it'll all be over in a minute!

181
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:07,689
Let me see your face!

182
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:11,163
What?!

183
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:19,682
What is this?!

184
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:29,670
Damn...

185
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:44,072
There, now the gas will
fill the room.

186
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:46,942
You can't escape now, St. Tail!

187
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:04,002
Try not to... breathe in...

188
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,517
as much as you can.

189
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:10,890
He'll see my face...!

190
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,725
I've got to get out of here!
Take it easy Meimi.

191
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:17,436
But... I can 't move!

192
00:14:18,346 --> 00:14:20,280
Aren't you going to flee, St. Tail?

193
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,983
Maybe I'll get to see your face.

194
00:14:25,227 --> 00:14:27,957
It's no use... I can't run away.

195
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,126
St. Tail!

196
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:32,432
Oh no!

197
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:39,886
My eyes are so teary,
I can't see!

198
00:14:44,064 --> 00:14:45,622
I can't see!

199
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:47,133
Tear gas?

200
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:51,639
It should have worked by now.

201
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:58,685
What the hell is he doing with her?!!

202
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:09,578
St. Tail!
Where is St. Tail!

203
00:15:09,884 --> 00:15:11,852
There couldn't have been a better
opportunity to catch her!

204
00:15:11,888 --> 00:15:13,150
What were you doing?!!

205
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:17,418
Idiot! "What were you doing!"
is something I should be asking you!!

206
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,161
I thought I was gonna die!

207
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:22,639
Killed you, my foot!
You two were hugging each other!

208
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,411
Rina! The Dagger of Yatto
has been stolen!

209
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,528
St. Tail!

210
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:37,031
Damn!

211
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:41,437
I'm sorry, but I'm taking
the dagger with me!

212
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:52,165
One!

213
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:53,405
Two!

214
00:15:53,507 --> 00:15:55,099
Three!

215
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,140
What?!

216
00:16:08,003 --> 00:16:11,370
Goodbye Mr. Detective.
It's been fun, thank you!

217
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:18,177
She did it again, St. Tail!

218
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,983
Damn it! Show me you face!

219
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:22,428
St. Tail!!

220
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:25,357
Hey you, what do you think
you're looking at?!

221
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,339
Thanks to you, I can't see a thing!

222
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:31,136
Stupid! Stupid! Super Stupid!!

223
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:33,050
Who are you calling stupid?!

224
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:36,655
We could've caught her,
if you held onto her tighter!

225
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,099
I don't want to have to use
tear gas to catch her.

226
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:42,432
What did you say?

227
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:44,798
I'll say this one last time!

228
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:47,369
I'm the one who will capture
St. Tail!

229
00:16:47,517 --> 00:16:49,178
Suit yourself! Humph!!

230
00:16:49,587 --> 00:16:51,179
Hey, wait!

231
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:52,017
Ouch!

232
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,917
I left security for this place
up to him because he's your son!

233
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:13,491
I trusted him, but...

234
00:17:13,536 --> 00:17:14,935
Are you listening to me?!!!

235
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,533
Do you know how valuable the
Dagger of Yatto is...

236
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,978
both as an archeological
and artistic treasure?!

237
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,680
It's so valuable, that no monetary
value could be placed on it!

238
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:25,724
How are the police going to take
responsibility for this?

239
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:31,031
Ah... it's a nice painting.
Don't tell me this is an imitation, too?

240
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:33,065
What?!

241
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:35,508
I've already investigated.

242
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:40,349
I hear that your Dagger of Yatto
is a genuine replica.

243
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:44,361
Getting the police involved
in your conspiracy...

244
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:47,732
that's taking it a bit too far!

245
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:57,945
"IT WAS A FAKE!"
What a stupid thief,
stealing a replica.

246
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:01,956
She ends up stealing for nothing.

247
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:04,364
That's not the point.

248
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:05,101
Huh?

249
00:18:06,912 --> 00:18:08,607
She knew...

250
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:12,107
She probably was helping
somebody out again.

251
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:14,152
Are you stupid?!

252
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,957
And just how would you know!

253
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:18,165
I know...

254
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:22,065
because I've been chasing
her all this time.

255
00:18:23,012 --> 00:18:25,207
Oh, is that so?!

256
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:30,681
St. Tail, I'll reveal your
true identity!

257
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,041
You were crying last night,
weren't you?

258
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:46,517
How did you know?!

259
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:48,561
'Cause your eyes are red.

260
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:51,328
Why did you cry?

261
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:52,595
Shut up!

262
00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:54,330
Hey, tell me why.

263
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:57,738
It's none of your business!

264
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:00,710
Men have a lot things to
attend to.

265
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:07,924
I know, it's because you're always
dedicated to the job you 're doing.

266
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,269
It's because you're kind.
