1
00:00:05,986 --> 00:00:08,750
I'm happy! I'm happy!

2
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:11,392
Tomorrow is going
to be a fun Sunday!

3
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:13,961
And I have free
tickets to Aqualand!

4
00:00:15,203 --> 00:00:19,196
All right! I'm going to ask
Haneoka for a date! Hooray!

5
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:23,946
I'm so happy...!

6
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,895
Haneoka!

7
00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:32,401
Yes?

8
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:36,977
They're cute!

9
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,103
What's up, Sawatari?

10
00:00:40,552 --> 00:00:41,917
What should I do?

11
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:44,688
There are two beautiful girls.

12
00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:46,886
And they're stunning
in their summer school uniforms.

13
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:50,262
One shines like gold
in the summer sun...

14
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:52,769
She's like a sunflower.

15
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:57,041
The other sits quietly
in the heart of the forest...

16
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:59,308
She is like a white lily...

17
00:01:01,357 --> 00:01:03,882
Oh, do I have to choose one?

18
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:08,158
Am I going to break up
their friendship?

19
00:01:08,404 --> 00:01:09,962
No, I can't!

20
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:14,406
Lord, please forgive my sins.

21
00:01:14,817 --> 00:01:18,981
And please show this
lost sheep the right way.

22
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:22,093
Five free tickets?

23
00:01:22,197 --> 00:01:23,755
Thank you for getting enough
tickets to include me, Saruwatari.

24
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:28,771
That's right! I have five tickets.
So all three of can them can go...

25
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:30,605
Asuka Jr.
What do you have?!

26
00:01:31,314 --> 00:01:33,009
Free tickets to Aqualand.

27
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:35,312
- Here.
- Wow! Thank you!

28
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:37,648
I feel bad taking these
from you, Sawatari.

29
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:39,162
What?

30
00:01:39,262 --> 00:01:41,093
- What are you talking about?!
- Don't hang on me!

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,430
Wow! A free ticket to Aqualand!

32
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,198
If you're going, I'm going, too!

33
00:01:45,508 --> 00:01:47,476
Hey! Hold on for just a minute!

34
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,074
First of all, there are
only five free tickets!

35
00:01:54,692 --> 00:01:58,219
Wow, perfect! Did you
have something to say?

36
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,534
No... Nothing.

37
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:06,666
"WHITE DOLPHIN"
- RETURN TO THE SEA!

38
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:19,467
As usual, there's
a big Sunday crowd!

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,398
Everyone! This way!

40
00:02:21,644 --> 00:02:22,804
They said the aquarium
is on the third floor...

41
00:02:22,912 --> 00:02:23,936
...and we need to use an elevator!

42
00:02:24,048 --> 00:02:25,015
All right!

43
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:35,357
I wonder if we could
get on the next one.

44
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:36,766
I guess we can get on somehow.

45
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,667
Here it comes!

46
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:41,235
We're going up.

47
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:43,613
Oh, wait for me!

48
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:45,517
We just made it!

49
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:52,160
Oh, no! How embarrassing!

50
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:53,825
Wait, Meimi!

51
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,201
We can easily
squeeze in one more!

52
00:03:02,554 --> 00:03:03,612
What was that?!
Did I see...

53
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:09,056
What am I supposed to do?

54
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:13,841
My hand...!

55
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,340
Shoot! I didn't let go of her hand.

56
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:22,523
Hey! You two!
You're too close to each other!

57
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,956
Break it up! Break it up!

58
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:26,155
Don't be ridiculous!
It's just the situation!

59
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,992
Good grief!

60
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,780
Hurry up...!

61
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,152
Get there!

62
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,723
Come on, third floor!

63
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:47,266
Second floor.

64
00:03:47,807 --> 00:03:48,865
Going up.

65
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:49,998
No! Wait!

66
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:54,674
It's gone...

67
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:00,392
Just the two of us...

68
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:05,734
What?! We lost Haneoka!

69
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:07,103
Asuka, too.

70
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:11,739
Oh, no! I thought we were going
to have an enjoyable day together!

71
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,412
She must be alone
and crying right now!

72
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,186
Asuka is with her.

73
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:18,586
Is this by any chance
a kidnapping...?

74
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:21,099
I told you, Asuka is with her!

75
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:24,736
Haneoka! I, Manato Sawatari,
am on my way to save you!

76
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,145
You're not listening...!

77
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:28,608
Don't worry!

78
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:32,614
If we go slowly now,
they'll catch up with us.

79
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:33,850
Right?

80
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:39,263
Yes! You're absolutely right!

81
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:41,596
He sure is quick
at switching his attention...

82
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,011
This is a great opportunity.
I want them to be alone.

83
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:47,285
I call this plan...

84
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,914
Seira's Love Love Strategy!

85
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:52,561
Isn't it great?!

86
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:55,029
Well, Mimori?

87
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:57,127
Let's go! Let's go!

88
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,530
You're right. Let's go.

89
00:04:58,641 --> 00:04:59,630
Hey! Wait!

90
00:04:59,743 --> 00:05:02,143
Don't leave me alone! Hey!

91
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:09,986
I guess they already went in.

92
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:12,656
It's because I forced myself
into the crowded elevator...

93
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:15,530
So you wanted to be
separated and all alone?

94
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:17,268
That's not what I meant!

95
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:22,250
Why do we always
end up like this?

96
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,728
Sawatari, what do you think of fish?

97
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:30,189
What?

98
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:33,435
I love fish!

99
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:35,097
Really? I'm glad to hear that!

100
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,377
- Sawatari.
- Yes?

101
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:41,383
Wouldn't you like
to breathe underwater?

102
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:44,889
Because it looks like
it feels good, doesn't it?

103
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:49,228
She's so cute!

104
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:50,998
All right!

105
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:53,208
I, Sawatari, for you, Mimori...

106
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,176
...will master breathing
underwater or anything!

107
00:05:55,282 --> 00:05:56,442
You name it and I'll do it!

108
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:58,643
Wow, wonderful!
I can't wait!

109
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:13,909
Why do things turn out this way...?

110
00:06:29,313 --> 00:06:30,644
Oh, no...!

111
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:38,423
- Well...
- What?

112
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,995
I spoke with St. Tail
up close the other day.

113
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,214
Really?

114
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:52,244
It's not a good idea
to bring up that incident!

115
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,516
I have to change the subject.

116
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:58,221
Why do you chase her
so passionately?

117
00:06:58,602 --> 00:06:59,591
She's my dream girl...

118
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:00,805
What?!

119
00:07:01,574 --> 00:07:03,371
Oh, no... I mean...

120
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:05,742
I want to see
if she's my dream girl...

121
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,409
I'm curious about
what she's normally like...

122
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:09,681
And many other things...

123
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:14,094
I'm glad...
I'm glad it is dark... But...

124
00:07:14,532 --> 00:07:17,092
But I continue to hide my identity.

125
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:21,030
It's the same as lying to Asuka Jr.

126
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,285
Resemble...

127
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,615
I can tell because
it was dark then, too.

128
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,254
It's not her physical shape,
it's more her aura...

129
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:33,088
She resembles Meimi.

130
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:37,967
Asuka!

131
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:39,508
Hey! Asuka!

132
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,649
What are you daydreaming about?
You're late!

133
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:44,486
Of course!

134
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:46,680
If we don't watch the fish carefully,
it would seem rude to them.

135
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:50,287
There's a creepy one! Let's go!

136
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:53,068
- Hey! Don't pull!
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

137
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,764
Look, it's a white dolphin!

138
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:06,853
He looks like he's having
a conversation with the dolphin.

139
00:08:07,232 --> 00:08:08,290
Seira...

140
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:09,569
Yeah...

141
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:14,111
Mana...

142
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:20,280
This is the Director's Office.

143
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:24,321
Director. That kid is glued
to the dolphin's glass again.

144
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,360
Again!

145
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:28,102
This is enough! Kick him out!

146
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:31,734
What an annoying brat...!

147
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,792
Then that white dolphin
is your friend?

148
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:46,227
Her name is Mana.
Do you know about Mana, Sister?

149
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:51,241
Yes, I do. I also saw you
at the aquarium the other day.

150
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,908
The director
of the aquarium said...

151
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:56,622
...that Mana was sick
and he could heal her.

152
00:08:56,793 --> 00:09:00,194
He lied to me
and took Mana from the sea.

153
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:03,268
Mana wasn't sick...

154
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:23,538
He never had any intention
of returning Mana.

155
00:09:23,744 --> 00:09:26,838
It's because Mana is a rare breed
called a Pearl Dolphin.

156
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:31,376
I've asked him many times
to return Mana, but...

157
00:09:32,394 --> 00:09:33,725
He refused, didn't he?

158
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:35,253
Did you talk to the police?

159
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:37,199
It's no use, Sister.

160
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:40,234
Mana isn't my pet.
She's my friend.

161
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:43,573
I'm not her owner
so I can't go to the police.

162
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,950
The director tells me...

163
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,283
...to show some evidence
that Mana and I are friends.

164
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:51,016
But it's impossible
because Mana can't speak.

165
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:53,661
Cheer up, Hiromi.

166
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:56,330
I'm sure God will help you.

167
00:09:57,141 --> 00:09:59,006
That's terrible!

168
00:09:59,478 --> 00:10:00,536
Wait for me, Hiromi!

169
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,681
The mysterious thief
St. Tail will get back Mana.

170
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,787
Hiromi says Mana can do
a trick only when Hiromi calls her.

171
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:12,032
Well, then...
If he shows it to the owner...

172
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:14,195
...he can prove they're friends.

173
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:15,774
But Mana is...

174
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:17,867
...so shocked from being
taken away from the sea...

175
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:20,281
...that she has
become very depressed.

176
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:23,414
And she has been
in that tank for a while.

177
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:25,216
So it is impossible
for her to do the trick...

178
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:26,651
I see...

179
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:48,526
I heard...

180
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:51,502
...Asuka had a good time
on Sunday, right, Yasuhiro?

181
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:53,709
That's what I heard, Chiba.

182
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,772
I heard he had girls
with him, Yasuhiro.

183
00:10:58,153 --> 00:11:00,144
I envy him, Chiba.

184
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:03,421
Boy! How pesky can you two be?

185
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,622
Sawatari had free tickets.
What was I supposed to do?

186
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:08,201
If you have a problem,
talk to Sawatari.

187
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:11,274
That's not the point.
Why didn't you at least tell us?

188
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:12,845
You're rude to us.

189
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:22,866
This is...!

190
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:24,835
"Tonight I'm going to Aqualand...

191
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:26,996
...to get the 'Pearl Dolphin.'"

192
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:29,707
It's St. Tail's warning note!

193
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,210
What's the Pearl Dolphin?

194
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:33,776
I don't know.

195
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:36,378
It's the white dolphin at Aqualand.

196
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,724
We've never been to Aqualand.

197
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,802
It must be a beautiful dolphin.
Right, Asuka?

198
00:11:42,904 --> 00:11:44,201
You two are really
getting on my nerves...

199
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:46,036
I'm home!

200
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:54,418
- Hi, Meimi.
- Welcome home.

201
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:55,961
What's this?

202
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,290
What did you do, Dad?

203
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,194
Isn't it romantic?

204
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:01,528
It's the illusion I'm going to use
in the next magic show.

205
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,681
It's like we're really in the forest.

206
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:09,719
Dad, can you change it
to the sea next?

207
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:11,415
Of course. Here!

208
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:16,991
Wow! It brings back
memories of our dates.

209
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,594
Yeah. We went
to the sea often, didn't we?

210
00:12:24,684 --> 00:12:27,744
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

211
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:34,033
One!

212
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:37,440
Two!

213
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,077
Three!

214
00:12:55,543 --> 00:12:56,510
Meimi...

215
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:59,975
I think Hiromi will
probably be at the aquarium.

216
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:01,074
Be careful.

217
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,287
All right.

218
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:08,259
May the blessings
of God be with us.

219
00:13:19,822 --> 00:13:21,585
This is our Pearl Dolphin.

220
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:23,884
Please protect her
from the mysterious thief.

221
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:25,790
- Yes!
- Put me down!

222
00:13:26,535 --> 00:13:28,765
Put me down!
Return Mana! You liar!

223
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:30,303
That kid again.

224
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:31,600
Excuse me...

225
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,777
You're still here?!
It's way past closing time!

226
00:13:35,017 --> 00:13:35,984
Director.

227
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:38,019
Like I've told you before...

228
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:41,092
...there's no proof
that the dolphin is your friend.

229
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:45,098
Mana will flip in the air
at my command. I'm not lying!

230
00:13:46,473 --> 00:13:49,067
I don't believe it.
She hasn't been trained.

231
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,770
If you're too persistent,
I'll report you to the police.

232
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,984
It's true! Believe me!

233
00:13:54,555 --> 00:13:56,523
Then have her do the trick.

234
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:59,224
If she does the trick,
I'll let her go back to the sea.

235
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:02,257
Really? Will you really?

236
00:14:03,003 --> 00:14:04,197
Really.

237
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:06,304
It's a promise between two men.

238
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:10,605
But I don't think the dolphin
can do a flip from the tank.

239
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:12,144
That's not fair!

240
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:14,951
Kick him out!

241
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,084
- Yes!
- Asuka Jr.!

242
00:14:16,563 --> 00:14:19,327
Bad news! St. Tail showed up
on the surveillance camera.

243
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:20,602
What?!

244
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:28,415
St. Tail...

245
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:31,850
Good evening, everyone.

246
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:34,422
The St. Tail dolphin show...

247
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:36,623
...will be starting
at the dolphin's stage shortly.

248
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:40,830
Tonight's special guest
is the Pearl Dolphin, Mana.

249
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:43,868
What?!

250
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:45,772
Move!

251
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:48,479
How could this be...?!

252
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:49,792
How did she open...

253
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,621
...the gate between
the tank and the stage?

254
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:54,929
- Let's go!
- Yes!

255
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:02,606
Here we are. Get off.

256
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:11,295
Hey, you brat!

257
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,103
Mana...

258
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:28,692
Return Mana! You liar!

259
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:32,195
Mana will flip in the air
at my command. I'm not lying!

260
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,668
Tonight's special guest
is the Pearl Dolphin, Mana.

261
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,519
Let's go, Hiromi!

262
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:43,381
Mana is at the dolphin stage.

263
00:15:44,797 --> 00:15:46,458
Hurry up!

264
00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:56,079
Mana looks depressed.

265
00:15:56,485 --> 00:15:57,645
St. Tail!

266
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,425
Mana!

267
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:01,718
Hiromi!

268
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,061
Mana!

269
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:07,499
Mana! Jump!

270
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,268
Asuka Jr.!

271
00:16:12,115 --> 00:16:14,345
What's going on, Asuka Jr.?

272
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:17,588
Get St. Tail now! Otherwise...!

273
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:19,387
Otherwise... what?

274
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:21,621
The dolphin will do a flip?

275
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:24,261
I won't ask you again!

276
00:16:25,307 --> 00:16:26,274
Mana!

277
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:28,367
Jump!

278
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,072
Jump, Mana! Mana!

279
00:16:32,321 --> 00:16:34,482
If you don't jump,
you can't go back to the sea.

280
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:36,926
Where's the flip?

281
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:42,392
If she doesn't jump,
I can't return her to the sea.

282
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:44,673
It's your fault!

283
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:48,344
Because you lied
and put her in the tank...

284
00:16:48,451 --> 00:16:50,351
...now she's really sick.

285
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:52,320
That's enough, brat!

286
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:54,595
Let go of me!

287
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:55,986
Mana!

288
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,394
Wait!

289
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,761
I'll make you keep
the promise with Hiromi!

290
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:01,898
What?!

291
00:17:06,953 --> 00:17:07,977
It's...

292
00:17:09,758 --> 00:17:12,556
...Show...

293
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,763
...Time!

294
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:28,786
Mana!

295
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:31,186
Open your eyes.

296
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,700
You're in the sea.

297
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,057
Mana...

298
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:47,060
Remember...

299
00:17:47,563 --> 00:17:49,053
...the fun time you spent...

300
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:50,632
...with Hiromi!

301
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,396
Remember the sea!

302
00:17:54,644 --> 00:17:55,906
Hiromi! Now!

303
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,341
Mana! Jump!

304
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:06,230
Mana!

305
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:08,623
Now you can go back!

306
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:11,464
You can go back to the sea, Mana.

307
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:13,812
I don't know about that!

308
00:18:15,216 --> 00:18:17,013
I don't know anything
about the promise!

309
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:19,487
Take the dolphin back
to the tank immediately!

310
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,151
No, Director.

311
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:24,087
You definitely promised!

312
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:26,024
I am a witness.

313
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,840
It's not a pretty picture
you're painting.

314
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,167
Shoot...!

315
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:32,978
I have no choice.

316
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:36,244
Asuka Jr.! St. Tail is...!

317
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:40,793
Wait! St. Tail!

318
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:43,626
Take care of the rest, Asuka Jr.!

319
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:45,900
I'm telling you to wait!

320
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:49,367
I have to catch you
no matter what!

321
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:51,372
What? Why?

322
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:56,091
Because I'm your dream girl...?

323
00:18:57,496 --> 00:18:59,191
If you say it just one more time...

324
00:19:00,168 --> 00:19:01,328
I...

325
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:04,875
You resemble...

326
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:07,413
You...

327
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:10,616
...resemble the girl
I can't stop thinking about!
