1
00:00:04,682 --> 00:00:07,515
I never imagined
that this day would come.

2
00:00:08,623 --> 00:00:11,387
That's right. I forgot
that girls walk slowly.

3
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:14,798
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:17,332
Oh, no. No need to apologize...

5
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:18,896
Well...

6
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:23,384
I love you...

7
00:00:24,988 --> 00:00:26,512
By the way...

8
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:29,060
I'd like to make it clear...

9
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,824
...there won't be any
of that daily diary exchange...

10
00:00:30,932 --> 00:00:32,729
...or using a beeper business.

11
00:00:33,203 --> 00:00:34,170
Needless to say...

12
00:00:34,272 --> 00:00:35,569
...there won't be any
matching clothes either.

13
00:00:35,742 --> 00:00:36,766
And birthdays...

14
00:00:36,877 --> 00:00:39,573
...Christmas, Valentine's Day...

15
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:41,577
...I don't...

16
00:00:43,222 --> 00:00:44,189
Don't worry.

17
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:48,161
I don't want anything...

18
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:02,279
I love you...

19
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:08,565
A FORMIDABLE FOE?!
A MISCHIEVOUS PIXIE'S TRAP!

20
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:17,508
Again...

21
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:20,319
I discovered
that this is the house...

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,859
...of the Mysterious Thief Lucifer...

23
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,792
...who is Eimi Haneoka.
Since monitoring this house...

24
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:26,570
...Lucifer hasn't shown...

25
00:01:26,672 --> 00:01:28,537
...any movement...

26
00:01:29,076 --> 00:01:31,806
...but her daughter
sometimes goes out at night.

27
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:35,651
And every time she goes out,
the next morning...

28
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:38,854
...there's an article about St. Tail.

29
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:42,399
Does this mean...?!

30
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:47,435
Hey! Look! Look at the article
about St. Tail this morning!

31
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:50,239
She escaped
from you again, Asuka!

32
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:52,476
Because he has Meimi now...!

33
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:55,856
He doesn't care about St. Tail!

34
00:01:56,996 --> 00:01:58,486
Ryoko!

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,033
Right?!

36
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:02,227
What kind of logic is that?!

37
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,568
Nothing has changed!

38
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:06,534
I will definitely catch her!

39
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:09,514
You want to impress Haneoka!

40
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:11,145
I see...!

41
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:12,781
Wow! Cool!

42
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:15,191
Why are you jumping
to all of these conclusions?!

43
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:17,926
How about this, Asuka Jr.?

44
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,306
It's the fortune teller.
I've heard she is pretty good.

45
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:22,466
A fortune teller?

46
00:02:22,578 --> 00:02:24,705
Oh, yeah. I've heard that, too.

47
00:02:25,217 --> 00:02:28,550
Yeah, why don't you ask her
about the location of St. Tail?

48
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:32,121
That's a cover story.

49
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,425
What he really wants to know is...

50
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:38,563
...how their relationship is going.

51
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:41,872
Right! This is great!

52
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:44,777
Let it go! Let's change the subject!

53
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:46,520
You guys...!

54
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,558
Don't get mad!
We're happy for the two of you.

55
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:51,889
That's right!
Finally you two got together!

56
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,276
Takamiya...

57
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:00,677
How could she, Haneoka?

58
00:03:00,951 --> 00:03:02,782
How could she choose
Asuka over me?!

59
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:05,923
Why? Haneoka?

60
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:08,519
Hey! Get away
from me, Saruwatari!

61
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:10,831
What's wrong...?

62
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,774
It's unusual to see you here...!

63
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:17,911
Mimori!

64
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:21,351
I came here to see you!

65
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:26,620
Boy! I can't even have
a broken heart in peace...

66
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:36,780
What?!

67
00:03:36,987 --> 00:03:38,045
Nothing...

68
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,449
I'm impressed, Takamiya.

69
00:03:44,868 --> 00:03:45,960
What else can I do?

70
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:49,433
First of all, those two took...

71
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:51,974
...too long to get together.

72
00:03:52,182 --> 00:03:55,447
Oh, I see. So half of it
was stubborn pride!

73
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:56,915
Oh, brother...!

74
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:04,902
I'm sure you'll have
God's blessings, Takamiya...

75
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:06,665
God's...

76
00:04:07,678 --> 00:04:08,872
It hurts...

77
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:11,179
My beautiful face...!

78
00:04:17,697 --> 00:04:19,028
When I'm hitting him...

79
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,101
...I feel good.
That's interesting...

80
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:23,970
That's terrible...!

81
00:04:24,343 --> 00:04:26,174
So God's blessings...

82
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:28,078
...may not be necessary...

83
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:29,384
FORTUNE TELLING

84
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:30,680
We've found it!

85
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,091
This is the fortune teller's house
that Kyoko was talking about.

86
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,201
You aren't interested in this
kind of stuff. Let's forget it!

87
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,879
Why don't you ask her
about the location of St. Tail?

88
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,649
That's all right.

89
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:54,859
You want to go in, don't you?

90
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,161
Let's go in.

91
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:02,714
It's dark.

92
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:09,521
Welcome!

93
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:13,532
That's the girl...

94
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:16,273
Excuse me, you two!

95
00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:22,752
Hello.

96
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:26,948
I've just opened
a fortune telling shop near this school.

97
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:29,358
Please come by
with your boyfriend.

98
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:33,268
Oh, my...!

99
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:35,700
Oh, welcome!

100
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:39,378
We've heard your fortunes
are very accurate...

101
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:41,388
You want to know...

102
00:05:41,556 --> 00:05:42,580
...whether you are right
for each other, right?

103
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,827
What...?

104
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,087
When I see you two, I can tell...

105
00:05:58,188 --> 00:06:00,850
Your names and dates of birth...

106
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:05,163
Meimi Haneoka,
born on September 29th.

107
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:07,064
And Asuka Jr. is...

108
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:10,237
Daiki Asuka, August 12th.

109
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,909
So he is Asuka Jr.,
special agent for the mayor...

110
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:17,813
What are you going to do
with the crystal ball?

111
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:19,026
Okay...

112
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,807
Well...?

113
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:48,838
A thick fog is
filling the crystal ball.

114
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:51,417
So I can't see you there.

115
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,768
I've never seen such thick fog.

116
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,608
And I can see a ring
around his finger.

117
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,210
This must be
about the secret promise.

118
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:08,186
It's a one-sided promise...

119
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:12,290
What? Is she talking
about St. Tail and Asuka Jr?.

120
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:16,357
It seems the ring can
never be removed.

121
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:18,534
His character
and straightforwardness...

122
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:20,140
...is indicated in this.

123
00:07:20,946 --> 00:07:23,608
As a result, this relationship...

124
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:25,616
...is doomed to failure.

125
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:27,380
Why?

126
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:31,756
You're hiding something
very big from him, aren't you?

127
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:35,695
I guess I've hit the bull's-eye.

128
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:40,114
Let's go.

129
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:44,746
That's why I hate
fortune telling stuff.

130
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:47,250
She knew things
without getting any information.

131
00:07:47,764 --> 00:07:50,562
Listen! That's nonsense.

132
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,465
Those who talk
nonsense and tell lies...

133
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:53,834
...are the worst!

134
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,646
Right?

135
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,811
Honest eyes...

136
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:02,683
Unremovable ring...

137
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:06,923
All right, then.
Let's go home.

138
00:08:07,802 --> 00:08:09,429
I'm getting hungry.

139
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:12,164
That's the sign...

140
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:14,677
...that he can't forgive
people who deceive.

141
00:08:15,283 --> 00:08:18,309
I'm sure he won't forgive
my being St. Tail...

142
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:20,959
I'm leaving!

143
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:24,457
That's a solid-gold statue of Mary.

144
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:28,528
Yesterday, a person
named Sakiko visited here.

145
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,201
She valued it a great deal.

146
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:33,416
But...

147
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,486
You know about Pandora...

148
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:38,318
...the fortune telling place,
don't you, Meimi?

149
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:39,393
Yeah...

150
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,294
Sakiko went there.

151
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:48,165
What?!

152
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:49,845
My statue of Mary?!

153
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:51,116
That's right.

154
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,983
That solid-gold statue of Mary...

155
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,818
...is bringing you misfortune.

156
00:08:57,463 --> 00:08:58,452
No way...!

157
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:04,196
You can bring
the solid-gold statue...

158
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:06,334
...of Mary to us immediately.

159
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:08,974
We'll take full responsibility
for its disposal.

160
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:12,152
You've got to be kidding!
How could I...?!

161
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,455
Are you prepared
to have misfortune?

162
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:19,870
I can't do it...

163
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:22,774
Do you understand?

164
00:09:27,954 --> 00:09:30,354
So did she give it away? Why?

165
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:35,390
I suppose
the fortune teller uses hypnosis.

166
00:09:36,137 --> 00:09:37,104
Hypnosis?

167
00:09:37,573 --> 00:09:41,009
So Sakiko can't go to the police...

168
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,172
Meimi?

169
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,247
- I went there.
- What?

170
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:47,049
I went to the fortune teller...

171
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:48,921
...and she gave me
a scary fortune...

172
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:54,193
If Asuka Jr. finds out I'm St. Tail...

173
00:09:55,106 --> 00:09:57,666
You've been deceiving me!

174
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,812
Let's stop stealing.

175
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:05,491
Seira...

176
00:10:14,376 --> 00:10:15,502
Meimi...

177
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:19,015
I appreciate what you
have done very much.

178
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,315
But you don't need...

179
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:26,019
...to see Asuka Jr.
as St. Tail anymore.

180
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:28,691
So let's end it.

181
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:33,641
I love you. I love you, Meimi.

182
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,140
No! We can't do it!

183
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:38,686
We can't desert those
people who are in trouble...

184
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:41,059
Meimi...

185
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,794
We have to get back
the solid-gold statue of Mary.

186
00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:52,644
Now it's lunch time!
Lunch time! Lunch time!

187
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:55,310
You brought a lunchbox
today, Asuka?

188
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,256
Yeah...

189
00:11:01,032 --> 00:11:02,021
It's been a while...

190
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:04,364
...since St. Tail
booby-trapped your lunchbox!

191
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:09,641
"Tonight I'll get
the solid-gold statue of Mary.

192
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:10,849
-St. Tail"

193
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,548
Oh, boy! She really
went all out on this lunch!

194
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,120
I envy you.

195
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:21,432
Hey, Haneoka.
Look at Asuka's lunchbox...

196
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,065
- Stop it!
- Then let us eat it!

197
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:31,179
Let me make lots and lots
of whatever you like...

198
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,927
Whatever happens
from this point...

199
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:34,951
COOKBOOK

200
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,553
...I hope I have no regrets...

201
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:47,277
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

202
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:53,663
One!

203
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:57,171
Two!

204
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:02,276
Three!

205
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:16,631
Meimi...

206
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:20,347
Please tell me
when things get too painful.

207
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:22,482
Please promise me.

208
00:12:23,422 --> 00:12:24,753
If it happens...

209
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,652
If it happens, then I...

210
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:29,587
...will become St. Seira!

211
00:12:31,236 --> 00:12:33,704
St. Seira...?!

212
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:36,145
One!

213
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:37,580
Two!

214
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:39,176
Three!

215
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:45,859
Thank you, Seira.

216
00:12:48,203 --> 00:12:51,297
May the blessings
of God be with us.

217
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:02,616
A solid-gold statue of Mary?

218
00:13:03,464 --> 00:13:04,863
We don't have any...

219
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:06,999
All we have are over there.

220
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:11,206
It's made of solid gold...

221
00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:13,643
Our store doesn't have it.

222
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,275
I'm sorry...

223
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,718
SAKURAI JEWELERS

224
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:22,721
We don't have such a thing...

225
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,596
A solid-gold statue of Mary...

226
00:13:26,174 --> 00:13:29,507
Our store doesn't have it...

227
00:13:29,614 --> 00:13:30,581
Really...?

228
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,652
Darn it!

229
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:37,524
That St. Tail! Where is it?
Where is the location?!

230
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:42,130
Where in the world is there
a solid-gold statue of Mary?

231
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,104
Mysterious Thief St. Tail!

232
00:13:50,854 --> 00:13:52,253
I'm sorry, Asuka Jr.

233
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:56,624
I didn't want you here...
where she is...

234
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,607
I came to get
the statue of Mary back.

235
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,710
You came here.
That's what I wanted.

236
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,785
I have several things
I want to ask you.

237
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:13,262
Now watch this.

238
00:14:15,234 --> 00:14:17,099
Doesn't this smell nice?

239
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:21,273
Now take a deep breath.

240
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,781
What's going on?

241
00:14:26,422 --> 00:14:27,855
This fragrance is...

242
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:32,523
The smell in a bathroom!

243
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:34,760
It's lavender!

244
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:41,079
Your date of birth?

245
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:44,847
September...

246
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:46,853
...29th...

247
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:51,300
I've heard it somewhere before.

248
00:14:53,374 --> 00:14:55,069
What is your father's name?

249
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:56,938
Haneoka...

250
00:14:57,347 --> 00:14:58,371
Genichiro...

251
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:00,078
And mother?

252
00:15:01,255 --> 00:15:02,347
Haneoka...

253
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:03,749
Eimi...

254
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:07,466
Are you...

255
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:09,001
...the daughter
of the Mysterious Thief Lucifer?

256
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,436
Meimi Haneoka?

257
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,478
You're Meimi Haneoka,
aren't you?

258
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,911
You are
the Mysterious Thief St. Tail.

259
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,578
Stop it!

260
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,161
Meimi Haneoka...

261
00:15:25,668 --> 00:15:26,692
Meimi...!

262
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:28,901
Are you St. Tail?

263
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:30,234
Stop it!

264
00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:32,413
You...?!

265
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:33,909
Stop it!

266
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:35,349
Stop! Stop!

267
00:15:36,823 --> 00:15:38,256
Meimi...!

268
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:42,823
Yes. I'm sorry.

269
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:45,965
I've been hiding it from you.

270
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:49,073
I was scared that you'd find out.

271
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,340
I was scared...

272
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:55,586
I was really scared...

273
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,732
Okay. That's enough.

274
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:05,030
I just wanted to know your identity.

275
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:08,473
You said some
unexpected things, too.

276
00:16:11,523 --> 00:16:12,956
Ms. Meimi Haneoka.

277
00:16:14,963 --> 00:16:16,453
What are you scared of?

278
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,863
I was hypnotized...?

279
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,698
Oh, no!

280
00:16:23,946 --> 00:16:24,970
I can't have my secret...

281
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:26,479
...revealed either.

282
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,380
I wouldn't be able
to continue my business.

283
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:32,351
- Your business?
- That's right.

284
00:16:33,097 --> 00:16:36,863
Stealing people's valuables?

285
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:43,508
Don't worry.

286
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:48,085
I'm not planning to reveal
your identity to the public.

287
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:52,024
Let me tell you what I'm thinking.

288
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:53,200
What?

289
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,659
I'm thinking of...

290
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:58,198
...taking revenge
on the Mysterious Thief Lucifer.

291
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:00,908
Lucifer...?

292
00:17:01,284 --> 00:17:02,273
My mom...

293
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,909
On my mom?

294
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:09,393
Then I'll take the statue
of Mary, Ms. St. Tail.

295
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:12,092
You can't do that!

296
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,700
One! Two!

297
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:15,810
Three!

298
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:28,293
Oh, the statue of Mary!

299
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:30,204
It isn't hot...

300
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,407
Was it magic?

301
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,287
I'll take the statue of Mary,
Ms. Fortune Teller.

302
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:46,064
How dare you...?!

303
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,459
St. Tail...!

304
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:58,391
What...?

305
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:01,688
St. Tail!

306
00:18:04,905 --> 00:18:05,872
I wonder...

307
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,531
...what will happen if she
continues with that business.

308
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,542
Her hypnosis...

309
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:14,011
You're Meimi Haneoka...

310
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,957
I have to stop her hypnosis...

311
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,928
At the time, my body got cold...

312
00:18:21,904 --> 00:18:24,498
I thought the real Asuka Jr.
was asking me.

313
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,108
I'm scared.

314
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:38,789
The solid-gold statue
of Mary was taken.

315
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:41,596
I'm sorry, Mother.

316
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:43,375
It was the most valuable item...

317
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:45,173
...out of everything
we've gotten recently.

318
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:47,382
- Maju.
- Yes.

319
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,882
Lucifer is living a normal life.

320
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,118
It won't be fun to make her suffer.

321
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:54,828
Don't you agree?

322
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,097
What...? Yes!

323
00:18:58,106 --> 00:19:01,007
And the daughter's pain
is her mother's pain.

324
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,377
Don't you think so?

325
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,651
Yes! I'm with you all the way!

326
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:06,754
Excellent.

327
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,891
We can have
more fun that way, Maju.

328
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:15,299
The Mysterious Thief St. Tail.

329
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:17,909
The battle is just now starting...
