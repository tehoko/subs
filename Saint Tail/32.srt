1
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:09,311
Mikako! Good morning!

2
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:10,481
Good morning!

3
00:00:10,592 --> 00:00:12,492
- Good morning!
- Good luck!

4
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:19,296
Meimi, you look
very sleepy today.

5
00:00:19,408 --> 00:00:21,171
Yeah, yesterday's homework...

6
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:22,245
Hey!

7
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:25,107
Why are you looking
so gloomy in the morning?

8
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,618
What did you say?!

9
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:29,987
With that expression on your face,
you can't enjoy the day!

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,188
Good morning!

11
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,798
You two are so close!

12
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:37,099
Mikako! What are
you talking about?!

13
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:41,344
You're running
this early, aren't you?

14
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,511
Because soon we'll
commemorate the year...

15
00:00:44,622 --> 00:00:47,216
...of the Olympics,
and we're going to have...

16
00:00:47,328 --> 00:00:48,795
...the Seika Open Marathon.

17
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:50,421
That's right! See you later!

18
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:54,296
Saruwatari was pretty excited!

19
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:57,070
He says that Mikako
will represent our school...

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,148
...and she's favored
to win the race.

21
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:02,519
I see... Mikako!
Good luck!

22
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:05,060
Thank you!

23
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:11,031
STEAL A WOMAN'S
MARATHON RUNNING SHOES

24
00:01:12,576 --> 00:01:14,544
Hey, Meimi! After school today...

25
00:01:14,646 --> 00:01:16,170
...can you go shopping with us?

26
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,474
All right!

27
00:01:18,053 --> 00:01:19,680
Hi, Haneoka!

28
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:22,824
I want you to go
somewhere with me.

29
00:01:23,262 --> 00:01:26,390
Sorry! I've just made plans.

30
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:30,665
Well, it has to be today.

31
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:33,779
To tell you the truth,
I'm writing an article...

32
00:01:33,883 --> 00:01:36,283
...about an attractive runner's
road to victory.

33
00:01:36,855 --> 00:01:37,947
I know! It's a special...

34
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:39,821
...about the senior, Mikako Tamura.

35
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:42,054
What's wrong with that?

36
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:45,794
Today Mikako will practice
on the riverbank.

37
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,205
I want to take some pictures there...

38
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,039
...showing her supportive friends.

39
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,873
I was wondering if you would be
one of her fans in the photographs.

40
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:56,154
Sounds like fun!
Let's all go together!

41
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:57,823
You told us your plan...

42
00:01:57,928 --> 00:02:00,192
...but your real purpose
is to take pictures...

43
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,597
...of Meimi, isn't it?

44
00:02:01,702 --> 00:02:03,397
Well, that's one of the reasons.

45
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,968
In the past week...

46
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:07,441
...I've been following her
in order to write an article about her.

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,643
But she doesn't look very happy.

48
00:02:09,918 --> 00:02:12,716
So I was wondering
if we could all try to cheer her up.

49
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,449
Good for you, Sawatari!

50
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:18,360
All right! I'm going
to be supportive of her!

51
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:20,101
Yeah! That's a good angle!

52
00:02:20,438 --> 00:02:22,201
Haneoka is in the middle!
Yeah! That's right!

53
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,297
Very good!

54
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:28,449
There she is! Mikako!

55
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:30,020
- Yay!
- Good luck!

56
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:41,671
Oh, all of you came!

57
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:42,745
Take this...!

58
00:02:42,947 --> 00:02:44,039
Thank you!

59
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:45,707
We're going to speed it up!

60
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:46,911
Yes!

61
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:03,676
Mr. Tsukamoto!

62
00:03:03,787 --> 00:03:05,049
Remember my shoes
that you had the other day?

63
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:06,680
What did you do with them?!

64
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,463
Go away!
We're in the middle of a workout!

65
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:13,994
Mikako!

66
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,134
Come on, Hiroko! Let's go!

67
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:17,336
All right.

68
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:22,711
I did it!
I captured their rivalry!

69
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:25,149
Was I wrong...?

70
00:03:25,494 --> 00:03:26,518
Yeah...!

71
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,173
Who's that girl?

72
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:37,712
She is considered
the biggest threat to Mikako.

73
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,452
She's Hiroko Hashimoto
from Seika Minami Academy.

74
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,721
She doesn't seem very nice.

75
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:45,262
She's the daughter
of the Chairman of the Board.

76
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:47,229
She has her own coach.

77
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,698
Oh, is that the man on the bicycle?

78
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:57,679
I wonder if something's...

79
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:59,120
...going on between those two.

80
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:09,575
Don't you need to practice today?

81
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:12,045
I don't care about practice...

82
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:16,178
I... I can't run anymore...!

83
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:20,454
If you don't mind,
could you tell me why?

84
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:24,231
The other day...

85
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:27,671
...we had a practice workout
at Seika Minami Academy.

86
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:29,644
Hiroko's coach...

87
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,307
...Mr. Tsukamoto approached me.

88
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,111
Mikako. As usual,
your times are great.

89
00:04:34,492 --> 00:04:35,618
Thank you very much.

90
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:37,220
I would like to see...

91
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:38,591
...your custom jogging shoes.

92
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:41,395
We'd like to check them out.

93
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,300
Sure!

94
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:47,906
He said he would
return them right away...

95
00:04:48,017 --> 00:04:51,350
...and I lent them to him
without being suspicious.

96
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:57,864
The next day, the shoes
were returned right away.

97
00:04:58,103 --> 00:04:59,536
But...

98
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,440
Ouch!

99
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:06,279
The shoes he returned
weren't mine...

100
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:09,113
...and a pin was hidden inside.

101
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,154
If I had been wearing
them in the race...

102
00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:12,923
...and didn't notice,
my foot would have been...

103
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,536
That's very cruel sabotage!

104
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:23,169
My shoes were custom-made
abroad for my feet.

105
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:25,215
If I order another pair...

106
00:05:25,422 --> 00:05:27,151
...they won't be here
in time for the race...

107
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,758
Without them my times
won't be good enough to win.

108
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,066
My real shoes must be
at Tsukamoto's place.

109
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:37,636
I went there to get them back...

110
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:39,404
...but they chased me away...

111
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:48,025
Don't worry. I'm sure
God will protect you.

112
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:59,911
All right, Hiroko!
That's all for today.

113
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:03,891
Thank you for the workout!

114
00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:12,409
Father...!

115
00:06:18,423 --> 00:06:20,015
Tsukamoto, you're positive...

116
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:22,526
...that you can assure
my Hiroko of a win, aren't you?

117
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,425
Of course!

118
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,067
When she gets first place...

119
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:29,672
...you'll keep your promise,
won't you, Mr. Chairman?

120
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:31,472
I'm aware of what you want.

121
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:34,279
If you've trained a runner
who took first place...

122
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:36,183
...it's easier for me to reward you...

123
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,383
...with a winning bonus
and a promotion...

124
00:06:38,494 --> 00:06:40,155
...to the school's Head Coach...

125
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:41,390
...at the board meeting.

126
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,060
I'll ensure that she wins
no matter what...!

127
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:46,473
I have a secret plan.

128
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,972
I'm counting on you.

129
00:06:48,112 --> 00:06:49,943
If my daughter
becomes the top runner...

130
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:52,142
...my position at the school
will be solidified.

131
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:55,584
Coach! In exchange
for my winning...

132
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:57,784
...he'll receive money
from my father...?!

133
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:06,202
Mikako's shoes were switched?!

134
00:07:07,148 --> 00:07:08,172
It's as I suspected...

135
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:10,476
Did you know about it, Meimi?

136
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,114
Well, yeah...

137
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,820
Then can you do it?

138
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:16,293
Of course!

139
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,168
St. Tail won't allow
cheaters to tarnish...

140
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:20,898
...the sanctity of sports.

141
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,242
But we don't have time.

142
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:26,374
The race will start
at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

143
00:07:26,886 --> 00:07:27,910
All right.

144
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:31,290
I should get Mikako's
shoes back tonight then.

145
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:32,383
You can count on me!

146
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:42,511
It's tomorrow at last.

147
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:46,544
Asuka, are you going
to watch the race?

148
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:49,155
The race is
being held during class.

149
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:51,092
But Sawatari was telling us...

150
00:07:51,232 --> 00:07:52,927
...he'd get permission
to go take pictures.

151
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:54,796
He is special...

152
00:07:54,972 --> 00:07:56,439
...because he's
with the school newspaper.

153
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,071
Then we should
get permission, too.

154
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,614
I'm Mikako's fan!

155
00:08:01,786 --> 00:08:03,583
Just because you're her fan...

156
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:06,522
...doesn't mean Sister is going
to give you automatic permission.

157
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,159
Let's go.

158
00:08:08,264 --> 00:08:09,231
You think so...?

159
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:12,839
"Tonight...

160
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,669
...I'm going to Seika Minami Academy,
in the track team's room...

161
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:16,573
...to get a pair of jogging shoes."

162
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:18,943
It's St. Tail's warning note!

163
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:21,281
I have to go!

164
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:22,378
Hey, Asuka!

165
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,295
I'm home!

166
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:29,366
Welcome home, Meimi.

167
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:31,063
Dad!

168
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:32,142
Mom!

169
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:33,469
Where are you?

170
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:34,635
Here! Here!

171
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:36,774
What? Where?

172
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:38,451
Over here, Meimi!

173
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:44,021
Oh. It's no use hiding...!

174
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:46,492
Aha! I've got you!

175
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:48,164
Ouch!

176
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,872
Success! Success!

177
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:51,410
Boy, where's Mom?!

178
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:53,812
Here I am.

179
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:56,180
Mom! Were you there all along?!

180
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:57,256
Yes!

181
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:58,756
Then the shadow
in the kitchen was...?

182
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:02,255
Here it is! It's my idea
for some new magic.

183
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:03,928
Using a mirror and a light...

184
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:06,471
... I can make an item,
which isn't there, appear.

185
00:09:06,976 --> 00:09:09,206
Wow! That's great, Dad!

186
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:11,907
Let me have
that trick for a moment!

187
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:15,049
Meimi! Why don't you
come down and have a snack?

188
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:16,551
Later!

189
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:18,260
Meimi may...

190
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:21,898
...seriously be thinking
about following in my footsteps.

191
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:23,297
I wonder...

192
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:29,877
Now let's get to work!

193
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:44,407
BASEBALL CLUB

194
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:46,004
TRACK AND FIELD CLUB

195
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,163
First place...

196
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,377
Could these be?!
Mikako Tamura's shoes?!

197
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:14,464
What's the matter?

198
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:18,005
Coach! These are
Mikako Tamura's shoes, aren't they?!

199
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,734
What's going on?

200
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:21,848
Why were these in our
locker room?! Please explain!

201
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:25,748
These are...
Hiroko, they're for you.

202
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,092
For me?!

203
00:10:28,397 --> 00:10:31,366
It may not be appropriate
for me to say this...

204
00:10:31,803 --> 00:10:32,770
...but to be honest with you...

205
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:35,739
...your current times aren't
good enough to beat Mikako.

206
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:36,811
What?!

207
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:39,037
I've done it because
I've been thinking about you...

208
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:40,982
...trying so hard to measure up...

209
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:42,578
...to the expectations of the school.

210
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,326
It's not fair...

211
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,624
...to take her shoes...

212
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:48,494
...and her chance of recording
a winning time! Coach!

213
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:51,966
I'm going to return
the shoes to Mikako!

214
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:53,042
Wait, Hiroko!

215
00:10:57,084 --> 00:10:58,051
That's...!

216
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,487
Stop it! Hiroko!

217
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:00,824
It's bitter!

218
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,525
Coach! This isn't
Mikako's special drink!

219
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,029
You did something to it!

220
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:07,731
That's what I'm telling you...

221
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:10,370
...I want you to win!

222
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:12,746
How dare you...!
I know that...

223
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,213
...my winning will make you money!

224
00:11:16,388 --> 00:11:17,912
You talked my father into this.

225
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:19,048
How dare you...

226
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,424
...make me your cash cow?

227
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,529
I won't run tomorrow!

228
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:25,603
I don't want to run
if I have to cheat my opponent!

229
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:37,656
Mr. Tsukamoto, Hiroko!
Is something wrong?!

230
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,087
No.

231
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,168
We're just getting nervous
because the race is close.

232
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:44,428
Is that right?

233
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,810
Asuka Jr. and the police are here.

234
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:49,648
Just a moment.
I'll be right there.

235
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:50,719
The police...?

236
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:53,284
Keep these shoes in the locker.

237
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:55,688
No one's going to get
suspicious seeing shoes...

238
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:56,956
...in the track team's locker room.

239
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:58,032
But...

240
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,935
Don't do anything stupid.

241
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:02,838
I'll take care of the situation.

242
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:05,905
You should think only of running.

243
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:10,656
A warning note?

244
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,786
Mysterious thief or whatever...

245
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:14,154
How can you investigate...

246
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:16,165
...every little tip?

247
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,963
But St. Tail doesn't steal
without a good reason.

248
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:21,701
The fact that it's
just before the race...

249
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:22,903
...makes me think
of something else.

250
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:24,683
Among your athletes...

251
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:26,445
...is there anyone
who could be her target?

252
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:29,582
We have an important
race tomorrow.

253
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:32,528
I don't want you to make it
a big deal, if possible!

254
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:36,568
We won't bother anyone.

255
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:38,703
Then suit yourself.

256
00:12:42,351 --> 00:12:45,650
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

257
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:52,002
One!

258
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,565
Two!

259
00:12:57,781 --> 00:13:00,614
Three!

260
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:16,002
Mikako's special shoes have...

261
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:18,307
...the initial "M."

262
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:19,881
Please be careful.

263
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:21,691
Count on me!

264
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:27,060
May the blessings
of God be with us.

265
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,826
Excuse me.

266
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:43,396
Hiroko! You're still here?!

267
00:13:44,336 --> 00:13:45,826
You'd better go home and rest.

268
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:47,269
Otherwise, you can't
run well tomorrow.

269
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:50,606
Coach, I'd like to stay with them.

270
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:52,106
Is she...?

271
00:13:52,251 --> 00:13:54,742
She's the ace of our team,
Hiroko Hashimoto.

272
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:03,629
What...?!

273
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,107
Mr. Tsukamoto and Hiroko.
Get out of the room!

274
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,302
All right!

275
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:11,045
It's St. Tail!

276
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:13,044
Catch her!

277
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:17,052
- She's outside! Chase her!
- Yes, sir!

278
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:28,305
Well, where are the shoes...?

279
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:33,792
These must be them!

280
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:37,425
Wait a minute.

281
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:39,332
She hasn't stolen anything yet.

282
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,211
This must be a dummy!
The locker room is at risk!

283
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:48,980
Darn!

284
00:14:52,498 --> 00:14:54,489
St. Tail! Come down!

285
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,502
Come down and give me a fight!

286
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:08,885
It's...

287
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:13,862
...Show...

288
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:16,069
...Time!

289
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:26,859
All right! I'm coming up!

290
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:30,766
What...?!

291
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,428
Hiroko! What are you doing?!

292
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,816
Hiroko! Come down!

293
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:42,418
If you can't race tomorrow,
my job is...!

294
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,120
That's what I want!

295
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:45,723
What did she say?!

296
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:49,598
St. Tail!
Why don't you attack me?!

297
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,372
She's trying to provoke me.

298
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:55,006
Asuka Jr., I beg you!

299
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,781
PIease stop Hiroko!

300
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:58,649
Of course!

301
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,791
And I'll catch St. Tail, too!

302
00:16:09,444 --> 00:16:11,537
Stay still up there!

303
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:15,111
Don't come any closer.
It's better if I get hurt.

304
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:18,114
What are you talking about?!

305
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:21,188
If I get hurt and can't race...

306
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,530
...you and my father
will think about it.

307
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:25,864
Come down, Hiroko!

308
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:28,535
Don't come any closer!

309
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,402
Mr. Tsukamoto!

310
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:44,634
I'm taking Mikako's shoes!

311
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:47,337
You'd better not interfere anymore!

312
00:16:48,818 --> 00:16:50,251
Mikako's shoes?!

313
00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:52,653
What's going on, Mr. Tsukamoto?!

314
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,521
What's the explanation here?

315
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:57,490
It's all over...!

316
00:16:58,437 --> 00:17:00,098
That's good...
This is the way...

317
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:06,813
TAMURA

318
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:11,585
These are...!

319
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,902
Thank you, God.

320
00:17:30,164 --> 00:17:31,153
Mikako!

321
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:32,693
Hiroko!

322
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:34,898
It's time to compete, Mikako!

323
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,806
Yes. I won't be easy on you!

324
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:40,705
On your mark!

325
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:42,612
Get set!

326
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:55,808
Mikako was very happy.

327
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:59,273
The coach confessed to everything.

328
00:17:59,486 --> 00:18:02,216
So Hiroko can also race
without any problem.

329
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:03,414
Really?!

330
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:06,428
Then the result of the race
is even more exciting!

331
