1
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,013
It's been stolen!
A picture more valuable than my life!

2
00:00:31,202 --> 00:00:32,794
It's Saint Tail!

3
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,092
Detective Asuka!

4
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:40,822
Okay!

5
00:00:57,389 --> 00:01:00,017
I'll definitely get some evidence
on you today, Saint Tail!

6
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:08,949
Ohh! Not the painting that I stole!

7
00:01:09,796 --> 00:01:10,728
What's that?

8
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:12,660
Oops. Nothing.

9
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:13,664
Detective Asuka!

10
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:15,070
This picture...

11
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:21,922
It's the painting "Evening Primrose",
stolen from the city museum last week!

12
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:25,939
Ah. It's... oh no!

13
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:26,942
Detective!

14
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,850
This is also a missing painting,
stolen two months ago.

15
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:33,621
Well! What is this all about?!
Shall we hear your explanation?!

16
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:40,327
Chance!

17
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:45,202
Ouch!

18
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:51,129
Darn!

19
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:04,732
Good morning!

20
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,076
Good morning!

21
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,431
Good morning Meimi!

22
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:15,171
Good morning.

23
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:18,045
Hey! Have you heard?

24
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:19,611
She appeared again last night!

25
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:21,121
Yes, she did, she did!

26
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:24,631
This time it was a mansion in Ward 16.
Meimi, did you hear about it?

27
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:28,547
You're talking as if
a strange ghost appeared.

28
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,015
Are you talking about Saint Tail?

29
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:35,661
Her ponytail flutters in the wind
as she steals only from the bad.

30
00:02:36,347 --> 00:02:39,714
Because of her classy figure
people call her Saint Tail.

31
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,424
But no one knows her true identity.

32
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:45,899
Her tactful capers
have never failed yet.

33
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,938
She's as lightfooted as the wind.

34
00:02:48,286 --> 00:02:49,583
She's just wonderful!

35
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,569
And just what's so
wonderful about her?

36
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:58,713
Saint Tail or Sacred Tail,
whichever it is...

37
00:02:59,323 --> 00:03:05,626
A thief is a thief!
How sickening, to call her "wonderful".

38
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,578
But I bet you'd like to meet her, too,
Asuka, Jr.!

39
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:14,025
No way! Saint Tail is a mature lady!

40
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:16,240
She wouldn't even look at you!

41
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,275
Isn't that right?

42
00:03:18,753 --> 00:03:22,450
Shut up! A pest like her!
This is what she looks like!

43
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:24,158
What did you say?!

44
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:27,371
You know what kind
of person Saint Tail is?!

45
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:30,047
These are her crimes for
just the past month...

46
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:36,355
Seven jewel robberies and
two stolen paintings, ten thefts total.

47
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:40,572
My suspicion is that it's all
because of Saint Tail.

48
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:45,355
That's odd... I don't remember
taking any jewels...

49
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:45,973
What's that?

50
00:03:46,713 --> 00:03:49,622
Anyhow, Detective Asuka keeps
slipping up again and again!

51
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:52,284
How can we believe
anything his son says?

52
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:56,901
Don't lump me in with my father!
I'll be the one who catches Saint Tail!

53
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:02,017
Saint Tail wouldn't be so cool
if somebody like you could catch her!

54
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:02,788
What was that?!

55
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,759
What about it?

56
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:06,599
Don't stop me Siera!

57
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,205
I'm not Seira!

58
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:12,185
Seira...

59
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:16,865
Miss Haneoka, Mr. Asuka!
The two of you just stay right there!

60
00:04:17,414 --> 00:04:18,073
Yes...

61
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,424
Excuse me, do you have a moment?

62
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:54,559
Certainly.

63
00:04:57,077 --> 00:05:00,774
Sister-in-training Seira.
Coldhearted Seira.

64
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:05,357
Coldhearted is much too cruel.
It is all the teachings of our Lord.

65
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:09,541
You passed a girl on your way in?

66
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,354
Her name is Saori.
She came to ask God for help.

67
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:16,739
Such a young girl?

68
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:27,919
Her grandfather is a jewelry appraiser.
One day, he was brought two sapphires.

69
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:34,376
One of them was the "Blue Meteorite",
a very unique and expensive gem.

70
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:38,202
As a precaution against theft
the owners had made a fake duplicate.

71
00:05:38,748 --> 00:05:42,013
But the duplicate was so well made,
that the gems got mixed up.

72
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,955
They couldn't tell which
was the real "Blue Meteorite".

73
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,138
That's why the dealer, Umido,
asked her grandfather for the appraisal.

74
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,575
How does God
fit into a situation like that?!

75
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:55,459
That's not the problem.
Now the grandfather is asking for help.

76
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:57,499
What do you mean?

77
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:07,260
He was taken in by the gem's beauty.

78
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:13,721
He lied to Umido, telling him that
the fake gem was the real one.

79
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:19,964
Then he bought the other gem,
the real one, at a cheap price.

80
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:30,173
That's fraud. He's a thief.

81
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:32,782
Anyone can make a mistake.

82
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:38,259
But a good human being regrets what
he's done and tries to correct it.

83
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:41,143
And today, we're going to be
of assistance with that.

84
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:42,887
Assistance?

85
00:06:44,364 --> 00:06:50,030
Thinking it was real, Umido sold the
fake "Blue Meteorite" to a rich woman.

86
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:51,912
So what are we going to do?

87
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:54,755
How do you think we should go
about making things right?

88
00:06:56,972 --> 00:07:00,669
Well, I think switching the real gem
that Saori's grandfather has...

89
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:02,778
with the fake gem that was sold
should do the job.

90
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:04,316
Exactly.

91
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:09,165
The real gem?!

92
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,488
It's time for you to make
your appearance, Saint Tail!

93
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,454
I'm home!

94
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,694
Welcome home, Meimi.

95
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:26,899
Welcome home, Meimi.

96
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:27,933
I'm home!

97
00:07:28,543 --> 00:07:29,874
Dinner will be soon.

98
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:35,253
How's that! It's my new magic trick!
Beautiful, isn't it?

99
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:40,900
Papa, you've got the hands of a wizard.
I love it! The next show will be a hit.

100
00:07:42,388 --> 00:07:45,084
The two of you are making
a mess of the room again!

101
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,291
What's wrong with it? Meimi, you're
going to take after me, aren't you?

102
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:54,779
Who decided that? Meimi's going to take
after her mother, aren't you Meimi?

103
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:55,528
Ah... sure.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,094
You've gotta be joking!
Your previous occupation was...

105
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:02,010
You're the one that took
one look at me and fell in love.

106
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:03,856
I'm getting out of here.

107
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:11,706
It's time to get to work.
I've got to help people in trouble.

108
00:08:37,403 --> 00:08:40,531
Oh Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

109
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:46,053
One!

110
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:49,565
Two!

111
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:52,913
Three!

112
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:13,040
May the blessings of God be with us.

113
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:47,189
This must be where
she keeps the safe.

114
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:53,035
That's strange... why is it open?

115
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:56,484
What?

116
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:05,480
It's been stolen!
The "Blue Meteorite"!

117
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:06,756
What happened?

118
00:10:06,864 --> 00:10:07,489
It's a thief!

119
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,801
Better get out of here!

120
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:33,913
Kaido?

121
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:47,719
Did it go well?

122
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:48,462
Yes.

123
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:53,104
This is great.

124
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:58,879
We steal back the gems that we sell
and then resell them to another sucker.

125
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,570
There are no rules in making money.

126
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:04,947
That's terrible!

127
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:06,922
Absolutely unforgivable!

128
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:25,535
Meimi... you can't! It's dangerous.
And I don't have information on Kaido.

129
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:30,289
Don't worry, nothing's impossible
for St. Tail! I'll get through somehow!

130
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,055
First, let's check out
the houses of the wealthy.

131
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:45,005
Then overlap that with the locations
of unsolved crimes for the past month.

132
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:50,722
So her next victim is...

133
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,470
Right here!

134
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:56,016
Saint Tail!
I won't let you get away this time!

135
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:12,701
The alarm went off,
so we came over to check it out.

136
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:14,812
What's happened, Mr. Kaido?

137
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:20,251
Actually, a kid got himself caught
in our alarm system.

138
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:25,170
At this hour? Who's the little brat?

139
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:27,848
Hey! Let me go!

140
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:32,935
Son?!

141
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:34,241
Dad!

142
00:12:35,152 --> 00:12:40,488
Detective Asuka's son, is it?
Well, how rude of me. Let him go!

143
00:12:41,072 --> 00:12:41,401
Yes.

144
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:45,942
Hey, son, what are you doing here?

145
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,850
Saint Tail is coming here!

146
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:48,987
What?

147
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:53,793
In the past month, this is the only place
that hasn't been hit by a theft. So...

148
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:56,315
Leave this to the police!

149
00:12:56,655 --> 00:12:59,818
You can't catch Saint Tail,
so I'm doing it for you!

150
00:13:00,335 --> 00:13:02,633
I've got other things to do
than chase Saint Tail.

151
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:04,678
I'm very sorry for all the trouble.

152
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:12,048
I'd like to meet this Saint Tail, myself.
I hear she's a great thief.

153
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:13,699
It's Saint Tail!

154
00:13:14,314 --> 00:13:14,643
What?!

155
00:13:22,373 --> 00:13:23,635
It's showtime!

156
00:13:25,217 --> 00:13:25,876
What happened to the lights?

157
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:26,820
They won't turn on!

158
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,781
Open the windows!

159
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:28,151
Yes, sir!

160
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:34,003
Saint Tail?

161
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,376
What the...?!

162
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:10,862
What's this?

163
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:16,436
I'll just exchange the fake
one for the real one.

164
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:41,559
May the blessings of God be with us.

165
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:54,334
So, that's what this was all about.

166
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,174
Asuka Jr. ...

167
00:15:02,537 --> 00:15:03,697
What are you doing?

168
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:09,680
Well, how ingenious you are.
Stealing back the gems that you sell!

169
00:15:10,296 --> 00:15:15,165
How dare you call me a thief!
What evidence do you have?

170
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,148
The evidence are these jewels,
Mr. Kaido!

171
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:21,952
These are all the jewels that
were stolen in the past month.

172
00:15:23,037 --> 00:15:24,163
Saint Tail...

173
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,248
She always has a
valid reason for her capers.

174
00:15:28,957 --> 00:15:30,925
Saint Tail is not a crook!

175
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:34,570
That man...

176
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:37,644
Mr. Kaido, the real crook is...

177
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:38,777
You!

178
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:40,616
You won't be rattling on for long!

179
00:15:55,578 --> 00:15:58,138
Saint Tail, you're not
getting away either!

180
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,286
Now I've got you!

181
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:02,727
Darn it!

182
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:07,676
Oh, no!
Don't look at me!

183
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:23,823
Saint Tail, don't be a coward!
Come down here!

184
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:28,444
Wait! Challenge me!

185
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:32,649
At least send me a warning
the next time you plan to appear!

186
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:36,366
Don't forget to do that!

187
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,876
That was a bit fun.

188
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:55,164
Detective Asuka!

189
00:16:58,586 --> 00:16:59,177
These are...

190
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:00,516
What is it?

191
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:04,919
Aren't these all the stolen jewels?

192
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:13,351
Saint Tail... She seems to be
about the same age as me.

193
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:18,574
I touched her.

194
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:34,626
Take care of your grandfather.

195
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:55,520
I present this award of appreciation
for the good deed you've performed.

196
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:56,464
Thank you.

197
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:07,959
And this one request, would you help us
in the arrest of Saint Tail?

198
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:14,061
This is an official
investigation badge.

199
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:18,269
Showing this will get
you in anywhere.

200
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:21,853
We definitely want to utilize your
expertise and knowledge...

201
00:18:21,993 --> 00:18:23,255
in the Saint Tail case.

202
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,827
Of course, with the cooperation
of the police!

203
00:18:26,141 --> 00:18:26,800
Yes, sir!

204
00:18:28,883 --> 00:18:33,149
Today, Saori came to church
to express her thanks to God.

205
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:39,268
They returned the jewel to its owner.
I guess that's the end of the case.

206
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:41,818
Then I'll be going.

207
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,854
See you tomorrow!
Bye bye!

208
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:51,012
Oh, it's you.

209
00:18:52,026 --> 00:18:53,288
I heard you got an award.

210
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:59,065
Yep! And next time,
I'm gonna get that Saint Tail.

211
00:18:59,718 --> 00:19:02,551
Well, anyway...
hang in there!

212
00:19:03,263 --> 00:19:04,855
Sure. Just watch me.
