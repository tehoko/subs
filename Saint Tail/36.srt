1
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,891
It's nice to walk in the forest!

2
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:14,554
I've heard that trees produce
elements which relax people.

3
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:17,899
The girls who are tired
of the business of urban life...

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,478
...are resting for a minute,
I suppose.

5
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:23,182
Hey! Why don't we
race to that tree?

6
00:00:23,387 --> 00:00:24,513
All right!

7
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,758
Are you ready? Go!

8
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,834
First place!

9
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:49,968
Man! I don't know if you're
tired from playing or what...

10
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:52,199
...but aren't you
missing the point?

11
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:54,142
We're on the mountain...

12
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:55,546
...behind the school
to observe nature.

13
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:56,641
But we are still in class.

14
00:00:57,188 --> 00:00:58,678
Mr. Yamano is amazed, too.

15
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:09,171
A PRECIOUS
CREATURE OF NATURE:
SAVE THE BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLY

16
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:19,489
It's like...

17
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:22,500
...when you put out cotton
soaked in sugar water...

18
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:25,200
...then different
insects gather.

19
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:28,305
Here, in particular, there are
many varieties of butterflies.

20
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:37,558
Beautiful!

21
00:01:37,703 --> 00:01:39,398
I wonder what those
butterflies are called.

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,164
Aren't they swallowtails
or something?

23
00:01:41,677 --> 00:01:44,305
They look a little
different to me...

24
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:47,518
They're called
Yamano Oomurasaki.

25
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:49,386
Yamano Oomurasaki?

26
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:51,818
It's the same name
as yours, Mr. Yamano.

27
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,123
As a matter of fact,
thirty years ago...

28
00:01:54,302 --> 00:01:56,634
...I discovered that butterfly.

29
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:07,994
The first time I saw it was...

30
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:10,563
...when I had just come
to this school.

31
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:28,425
Here it is!

32
00:02:28,972 --> 00:02:30,530
"Yamano Oomurasaki.

33
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,639
Discovered by
Mr. Ikutaro Yamano in 1966.

34
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,844
Found in a few small areas
like Seika City."

35
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:41,085
At that time there was
a lot of green around here.

36
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:42,527
But the groves
around here...

37
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:43,861
...have been
destroyed one by one.

38
00:02:44,102 --> 00:02:46,070
Now we can only see
Yamano Oomurasaki...

39
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:48,867
...right here
in the forest of St. Paulia.

40
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:50,442
Poor things...

41
00:02:50,882 --> 00:02:52,941
But it's not all bad.

42
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:56,381
A few years ago,
a law was passed...

43
00:02:56,493 --> 00:02:58,324
...which prohibits taking
any insects from this forest.

44
00:02:58,564 --> 00:02:59,997
Can you guys hear me?

45
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:19,062
Mr. Yamano has a butterfly
named after him.

46
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:20,899
He's great!

47
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:22,101
He deserves his position...

48
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,438
...as the special advisor
here at St. Paulia Academy.

49
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:24,774
He's super nice!

50
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,314
What's that? I heard
"great" and "super nice."

51
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:29,082
Is someone
talking about me?

52
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,656
Is it Haneoka or Mimori?

53
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:36,129
Hey! What are you doing?!

54
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:39,767
Start cleaning
like you're supposed to!

55
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,371
If you don't, I'll be scolded
as the group leader!

56
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:45,211
All right. I understand,
Group Leader!

57
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,360
Hey, Takamiya. You, too,
come here and help us.

58
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:51,591
All right...!

59
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:58,238
Bagworm...!

60
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:02,454
The bagworm scared me!

61
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,297
Asuka! I was scared!

62
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:11,738
Let go of me!

63
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:13,842
It's hard to believe
that Takamiya has...

64
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:15,609
...something she's afraid of...

65
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:16,843
Right, Meimi?

66
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:24,693
Hey, what kind
of insect don't you like?

67
00:04:25,204 --> 00:04:27,263
I suppose... ants.

68
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:30,234
How about you, Kyoko?

69
00:04:30,347 --> 00:04:31,609
For me it's a mantis.

70
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:36,082
I just can't stand that face.

71
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,419
What don't you like?

72
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:41,359
- Well...
- Yours must be this...

73
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:42,592
Here!

74
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:48,539
Oh, shoot...!

75
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,140
Asuka!

76
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:04,309
You boiled the pasta
too long today.

77
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:05,877
If you're going to complain...

78
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:07,816
...why don't you cook
once in a while?!

79
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:10,548
And what happened
to your face?

80
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:11,923
Nothing.

81
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:13,660
It's a girlfriend, isn't it?

82
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:15,964
No!

83
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,628
I remember when...

84
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,437
...great-great-grandfather
would tell us...

85
00:05:19,713 --> 00:05:22,113
...that we're a family who
has trouble with women.

86
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:24,013
Shut up!

87
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:33,129
Oh, shoot. I did it again.

88
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:35,698
He must be very angry now.

89
00:05:38,383 --> 00:05:40,214
Hey, Ruby!

90
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:30,349
Mr. Yamano...

91
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,879
Mimori...

92
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,929
You can't find a single
Yamano Oomurasaki?

93
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:41,934
Who would do
such a terrible thing?

94
00:06:42,946 --> 00:06:44,937
I hate to accuse anyone...

95
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:47,509
...but I can guess who did it...

96
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:53,559
About a week ago,
two young men visited me.

97
00:06:55,203 --> 00:06:58,297
So you want to collect
a Yamano Oomurasaki...

98
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,479
...in the forest of St. Paulia, right?
It's impossible.

99
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:05,520
This is a protected habitat
for the Yamano Oomurasaki.

100
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,186
The law prohibits
their collection.

101
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:11,832
So why don't you
give up and go home?

102
00:07:12,004 --> 00:07:15,633
Mr. Yamano,
we already knew that.

103
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:18,337
That's why we came here
to discuss it with you.

104
00:07:19,385 --> 00:07:22,479
How about just a few?

105
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:24,024
No one would know.

106
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:25,820
I won't do that!

107
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:31,836
Idiots!
Don't come back again!

108
00:07:34,381 --> 00:07:38,340
I suppose they did it
as revenge for my refusal.

109
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,920
Mimori, no, Sister...

110
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:44,692
Will you hear my prayer?

111
00:07:44,802 --> 00:07:45,791
What is it?

112
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:49,809
Could you ask God,
with me...

113
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,272
...that those butterflies...

114
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:55,419
...will return to the forest
of St. Paulia again?

115
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:56,950
Mr. Yamano...

116
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:06,845
That's terrible!

117
00:08:07,114 --> 00:08:08,809
I investigated...

118
00:08:08,984 --> 00:08:11,145
...and discovered that
Mr. Yamano was correct.

119
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:13,653
The two men,
Yoshiyuki Ishida...

120
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,317
...and Kenichi Kawai live in
a European-style building...

121
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:16,987
...on Seventh Avenue.

122
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:18,968
On the surface they pretend...

123
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:20,867
...to be regular
butterfly collectors.

124
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:22,097
But behind the scenes...

125
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,370
...they're selling rare butterflies...

126
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,674
...which are illegal to catch,
and fetch a lot of money.

127
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:28,519
Good job, Seira!
A wonderful investigation!

128
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:31,957
So what happened
to the Yamano Oomurasaki?

129
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,097
Don't worry.

130
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:36,030
The men are still hiding
the butterflies in their house.

131
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,563
Meimi...

132
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:39,106
For Mr. Yamano's sake...

133
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:41,508
...please get
the Yamano Oomurasaki back.

134
00:08:42,617 --> 00:08:43,641
All right!

135
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:46,184
Those men are enemies
of the entire earth!

136
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,724
St. Tail will teach them
a harsh lesson!

137
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:56,534
NIKO NIKO MART
FRESH-MADE OMUSUBI

138
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:04,893
Shoot! It's a miss.

139
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,593
How about yours?

140
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:08,332
Mine, too.

141
00:09:09,138 --> 00:09:11,163
Asuka, how about yours?

142
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,476
"Tonight I'll take
the Yamano Oomurasaki...

143
00:09:16,585 --> 00:09:18,780
...from the Ishida residence
on Seventh Avenue.

144
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,879
-St. Tail"

145
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,659
It's a warning note!

146
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,459
I licked St. Tail's
warning note...

147
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:28,904
- Let me lick it, too!
- Me, too!

148
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:30,706
What are you doing?!

149
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,191
Eimi, can you come here?

150
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:39,263
What's up?

151
00:09:43,406 --> 00:09:44,805
I've just had an idea.

152
00:09:45,076 --> 00:09:46,703
For the opening
of my next magic show...

153
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:48,711
...how about this?

154
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:51,314
Oh, are doves coming out?

155
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:53,352
Not really.

156
00:09:57,234 --> 00:09:58,667
Wow! Beautiful!

157
00:09:59,304 --> 00:10:00,430
Really, Eimi?

158
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,734
Yes, really!

159
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:04,572
I'm sure your next show is
going to be another success!

160
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,042
Eimi...

161
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:09,020
Genichiro...

162
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:23,013
It's really embarrassing...

163
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:25,620
Oh, well.

164
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:27,486
It's a little early,
but I guess I should go.

165
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,824
Ruby, cover for me
while I'm gone!

166
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:47,621
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

167
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,138
One!

168
00:10:56,352 --> 00:10:57,444
Two!

169
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:02,058
Three!

170
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,086
Meimi, tonight you're
dealing with butterflies.

171
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:19,853
Please be more
careful than usual.

172
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,827
Yes. You can count on me!

173
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,768
May the blessings
of God be with us.

174
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:53,853
Ishida, are they
that interesting?

175
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,466
They're just butterflies.

176
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:57,264
Just butterflies?

177
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,073
These are some
of the last in the whole world.

178
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:00,644
They're Yamano Oomurasaki!

179
00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:04,447
Look at these beautiful,
colorful patterns and shapes!

180
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:07,519
They are jewels
made by the gods.

181
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,761
Sir, you have guests.

182
00:12:11,268 --> 00:12:13,065
Who's here at this hour?

183
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:15,070
He said he's Asuka Jr.

184
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:16,773
Asuka Jr.?

185
00:12:17,514 --> 00:12:18,776
Is it the Asuka Jr. ...

186
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,406
...who is the special
investigator of St. Tail?

187
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:21,520
Yes.

188
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:23,391
That means...

189
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,559
...St. Tail is after them...

190
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:27,492
Calm down.

191
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:29,468
Without any evidence...

192
00:12:29,638 --> 00:12:31,731
...no one can do anything to us.

193
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:34,442
All right. Tell him
we'll be with him in a minute.

194
00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:35,603
Yes.

195
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:41,620
If they discover
these here, I'll be...

196
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,323
Don't worry.

197
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:45,228
We'll hide them
in the usual place.

198
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:54,942
Are you Asuka Jr.?
What's the problem?

199
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:57,487
St. Tail warned us...

200
00:12:57,594 --> 00:12:59,926
...that she will steal some
Yamano Oomurasaki.

201
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,089
Where are the butterflies?

202
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:03,662
That's strange.

203
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,506
We don't have those
butterflies in our collection.

204
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:09,143
Anything wrong?

205
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:10,411
Nothing...

206
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,954
It is true that our hobby
is collecting butterflies.

207
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,360
But it's illegal to catch
a Yamano Oomurasaki.

208
00:13:20,673 --> 00:13:23,335
There is no way
we would have them.

209
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:25,775
So you're sure...

210
00:13:25,883 --> 00:13:27,043
...that there aren't...

211
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,619
...any Yamano Oomurasaki
in this house?

212
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,350
I've had enough!

213
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,988
If you don't believe us...

214
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:33,653
...why don't you
search the house?

215
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:49,320
There's a pool...
They live in a mansion.

216
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:51,358
He inherited it.

217
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:54,031
How is your search going?

218
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:55,833
Well, Asuka Jr. ...

219
00:13:55,977 --> 00:13:58,571
We haven't seen
a single butterfly outside.

220
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:02,146
I see. That's enough out here.
Please help us inside.

221
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:03,324
Yes.

222
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:11,865
I have to fiind the butterflies
before Asuka Jr. does.

223
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:18,043
Where on earth
are they hiding them?

224
00:14:22,397 --> 00:14:23,364
I see!

225
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:26,397
Asuka Jr., we haven't
found any on the first floor.

226
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:28,268
There aren't any
on the second floor or in the attic.

227
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:30,371
Why don't you admit...

228
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:33,175
...that you've made
a mistake, Asuka Jr.?

229
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,579
It can't be right...

230
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:36,148
It's impossible...

231
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:38,658
...that St. Tail would send
a fake warning note.

232
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:42,394
Rather than listening
to the words of a citizen...

233
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:44,562
...you trust the words of a thief?

234
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:48,970
How rude! I told the truth!

235
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:51,842
St. Tail!

236
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,389
It's...

237
00:15:00,004 --> 00:15:02,700
...Show...

238
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:04,874
...Time!

239
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:19,001
It's the butterflies' curse!

240
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,141
I'm not deceived
by this illusion!

241
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:27,715
Good evening!

242
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,489
I came to pick up
the Yamano Oomurasaki!

243
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:33,526
St. Tail! Battle with me!

244
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,466
One!

245
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:36,600
Two!

246
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:37,803
Three!

247
00:15:49,571 --> 00:15:51,061
Yamano Oomurasaki!

248
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:53,403
We searched everywhere,
and we couldn't find them...!

249
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:55,141
There's a difference out here!

250
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:56,215
What?!

251
00:15:56,985 --> 00:15:58,384
That's what I said...

252
00:15:58,622 --> 00:16:01,557
...but I just saw the reflection
of the wings by the moonlight.

253
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:06,066
They're my butterflies!

254
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,228
Give them back!

255
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:08,931
Arrest these guys!

256
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:15,883
I'm taking these butterflies!

257
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,917
I won't let you escape!

258
00:16:24,507 --> 00:16:25,906
Wait!

259
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,659
He definitely did a belly flop!

260
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:40,395
Are you all right?

261
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:44,540
Shut up! Next time
I'll definitely catch you!

262
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:45,614
All right!

263
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,021
God, thank you very much.

264
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:55,721
Good morning!

265
00:17:55,856 --> 00:17:56,823
Good morning!

266
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,758
Oh, I wonder what it is...

267
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:08,505
"St. Tail shows up
at the butterfly mansion!"

268
00:18:09,382 --> 00:18:10,849
Good morning, Haneoka!

269
00:18:10,986 --> 00:18:13,955
Look at my big scoop!

270
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:18,628
So it was the same people
who damaged our mountain.

271
00:18:19,002 --> 00:18:20,936
Besides the Yamano Oomurasaki...

272
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,405
...those men were selling
other butterflies, too.

273
00:18:24,045 --> 00:18:26,946
Mr. Yamano must
be relieved now.

274
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:29,977
By the way, Sawatari...

275
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,716
...don't you have
some other big news?

276
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:35,758
Women's intuition
is very sharp!

277
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,500
As a matter of fact, although
I didn't put it in the article...

278
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,973
...the best scoop from last night
is this photograph!

279
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,777
You mean the real
identity of St. Tail?!

280
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:46,580
I wonder...

281
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:48,158
Let me see! Let me see!

282
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:52,191
What's this?

283
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:56,902
What is it?
An exclusive photo?

284
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:00,646
Let me see, too.

285
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,679
Saruwatari...

286
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:08,429
I didn't take that photo...

287
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:09,524
...but my acquaintance...

288
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,067
...happened to have a camera...

289
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:12,162
Saruwatari!

290
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,574
Boy...
Oh, a butterfly!

291
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:17,844
Ah-cho!

292
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:19,745
Wait a minute!
