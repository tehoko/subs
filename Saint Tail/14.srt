1
00:00:12,575 --> 00:00:16,602
All I can say is
what we have is true love.

2
00:00:17,954 --> 00:00:18,750
Oh, Joseph.

3
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,407
Are you forsaking our love?!

4
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:34,188
I'll never forget you, Joseph!

5
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,321
Joseph!

6
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:55,698
It was an old movie, but I know why
Meimi's parents recommended it.

7
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:57,803
Yes, it was great!

8
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,215
Gee, how I hope I find
a love like that one day.

9
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:07,461
He kinda looked like Asuka.

10
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:09,606
Meimi, are you listening?

11
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,346
Huh? Oh, sorry.

12
00:01:11,483 --> 00:01:15,078
Let's go out and find us
some fantastic boyfriends!

13
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:17,986
Yeah, let's go!

14
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:27,136
The Platform of Love and Tears

15
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,057
And how was the movie?

16
00:01:34,504 --> 00:01:36,443
It was the best!

17
00:01:36,443 --> 00:01:37,569
It was so touching.

18
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:39,937
It was a true love story.

19
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,629
They fall in love
despite their differences.

20
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:46,529
But in the end, they part.

21
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:48,401
Joseph!

22
00:01:48,805 --> 00:01:51,899
The actor who played
Joseph was so handsome.

23
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,653
How sickening.
What's all this mush about?

24
00:01:57,994 --> 00:02:00,758
How dare you eavesdrop on us!

25
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:02,166
Humph.

26
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:06,769
Why do girls always get so excited
when they talk about love and stuff?

27
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:10,119
You wouldn't understand
about true love!

28
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:12,417
And I don't care.

29
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:14,830
Of course you don't.

30
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,560
All you ever think
about is St. Tail.

31
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,677
What's that?!

32
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:21,371
Well, it's the truth!

33
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:22,541
Listen, I'm...!

34
00:02:23,087 --> 00:02:24,076
Yeah, what?

35
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:26,590
Never mind.

36
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:33,571
Asuka Jr. ...

37
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:44,996
You've traveled all of
Japan on a bicycle?

38
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:46,733
Yes.

39
00:02:47,012 --> 00:02:50,277
And I met Minako here in this city
on the last leg of my trip.

40
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,217
How romantic.

41
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:56,761
But then his bicycle...

42
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,911
Wow, that's so cool!

43
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:19,656
Not really, if you
have the determination...

44
00:03:19,656 --> 00:03:20,782
you could do it as well, Minako.

45
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:21,621
Really?

46
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:25,666
Since you live in Japan,
you can try it anytime you like.

47
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,567
Then maybe I'll give it try.

48
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:30,978
Still, I'm really glad I got to
meet someone nice like you, Minako.

49
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:34,780
I've met a lot of people along
the way but none so nice as...

50
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:38,331
Hey, wait!

51
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:42,903
Wait!

52
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:44,002
Wait!

53
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:10,268
Give me back my bike!

54
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:12,709
Who are you?!

55
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:14,451
Please open this gate!

56
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,781
Shut up!

57
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:19,628
John!

58
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:22,838
What is all the commotion?

59
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:27,069
Madame, these people
are demanding to be let in.

60
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:34,289
A boy took John's bike
and went into the gate.

61
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:34,993
That's why we...

62
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:37,162
Are you accusing
my son Tatsuo?!

63
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:38,643
That's right.

64
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:42,480
You must be joking.

65
00:04:42,688 --> 00:04:46,624
Tatsuo has a first class American
bicycle, ordered especially for him.

66
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,431
My name is on that bicycle.

67
00:04:49,672 --> 00:04:50,832
Please go check!

68
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:51,836
Enough!

69
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:55,208
I don't want to hear any more of
your ridiculous accusations!

70
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,850
Please leave!

71
00:04:59,028 --> 00:04:59,722
I see.

72
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:03,926
We went back several times,
but no one would listen to us.

73
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:08,572
And since it concerns a child, John
doesn't want the police involved.

74
00:05:09,052 --> 00:05:14,900
That bike was my best friend.

75
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,800
We'd been through good times
and bad times on our travels.

76
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:23,271
All we can do is wait for the boy to
return the bicycle on his own.

77
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:25,782
I understand.

78
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,585
Let us pray.

79
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:30,893
I'm sure our prayers
will be answered.

80
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:36,140
John and Minako.
They're in love, aren't they?

81
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:38,051
Yes, you may be right.

82
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:39,655
Such a dramatic meeting.

83
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:45,564
And their love will burn furiously,
only to end in a sad parting of ways.

84
00:05:46,976 --> 00:05:48,705
Ah, Meimi...

85
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:52,479
Alright.
I'll take care of it!

86
00:05:52,756 --> 00:05:54,724
Only we don't have much time.

87
00:05:55,898 --> 00:06:00,028
John is returning to America
on the last flight this evening.

88
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:01,701
We have to get it back by then.

89
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:04,338
Very well!

90
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:08,215
I'll do everything I can
in honor of their love!

91
00:06:10,032 --> 00:06:11,021
Meimi...

92
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,068
Dad is a pain.

93
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:18,277
He insists on eating Oden tonight.

94
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:23,082
Ah, this is my favorite...

95
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:24,288
I'll put a lot in.

96
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:30,782
"I will be at the Ninomiya residence
tonight to retrieve a bicycle."

97
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:31,874
"St. Tail."

98
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,066
How'd she know
this was my favorite?

99
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:43,871
Very good!

100
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:53,860
Ruby, that's fantastic!

101
00:06:56,777 --> 00:06:58,745
Meimi, it's time for dinner!

102
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,382
Okay!

103
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:07,496
Yum. We're having Oden tonight.

104
00:07:20,534 --> 00:07:21,865
Ruby!

105
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,533
There, Ruby's aerial
merry-go-round.

106
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,935
Wonderful!

107
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:42,106
Yes, you can use it
in your next magic show.

108
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:46,018
Would you like
to be part of my show?

109
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:05,096
Wow, look at all this stuff!

110
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:08,169
Take whatever you want.

111
00:08:11,555 --> 00:08:12,954
And where's the bicycle?

112
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:14,683
Over there.

113
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:20,778
I don't care if that
bike gets stolen.

114
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:21,836
Do whatever you want.

115
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:25,879
But isn't it
supposed to be special?

116
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:27,321
Not really.

117
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:31,671
If that's how you feel...

118
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:35,368
we should have given it
to that bothersome American.

119
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:39,313
What? Yeah that's right.

120
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:45,496
Please take care of the situation.

121
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:55,859
Tatsuo Ninomiya

122
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:59,365
Now, why would St. Tail
want to steal this?

123
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:13,663
Lord forgive me, for I use
no gimmick or trick.

124
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:19,813
One!

125
00:09:22,393 --> 00:09:23,451
Two!

126
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:27,858
Three!!

127
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:44,163
In order for John
to make his flight tonight...

128
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:47,742
he must take the train by 9 pm.

129
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,544
9 pm at the station.

130
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:50,890
Okay.

131
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,734
May God's blessings be with us.

132
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:36,087
Alright, I want this room and
the house closely guarded.

133
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:37,465
Yes, sir!

134
00:10:56,518 --> 00:10:57,507
It's?

135
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:01,721
It's Show Time!

136
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:12,145
What is this?!

137
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:17,020
This is...

138
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:26,953
Hi!

139
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:29,653
St. Tail!

140
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:31,555
What?

141
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:40,211
Taking what is not
yours is very bad!

142
00:11:40,624 --> 00:11:42,182
I don't know what
you're talking about!

143
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:43,489
Oh, really?

144
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,948
Now do you remember?

145
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:55,185
I'm sorry!

146
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:57,383
It was so cool,
I couldn't help myself!

147
00:11:57,798 --> 00:11:59,493
So you stole it!

148
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:01,102
Alright, you're forgiven.

149
00:12:08,524 --> 00:12:10,321
St. Tail! Come on out!

150
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:13,726
Now for the real Show Time!

151
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,374
What happened?!

152
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:21,585
Stay calm!

153
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:23,586
Somebody go check the fuse box!

154
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:24,685
Hurry!

155
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:39,152
One!

156
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:40,453
Two!

157
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,001
This is the second floor!

158
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:44,368
Three!

159
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:55,359
Impossible.

160
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:57,672
A bicycle that flies...

161
00:13:02,754 --> 00:13:04,085
Or something like that.

162
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:11,190
Now, I'll let the wind carry me
right to the station.

163
00:13:16,453 --> 00:13:18,318
What?! You're not going to?!

164
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:26,206
Bring the patrol car around!

165
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,152
Oh yeah! I have an extra
balloon here somewhere.

166
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:41,772
You're not getting away
this time, St. Tail!

167
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,297
Here goes!

168
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:54,031
I did it! I got you!

169
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:56,473
Asuka Jr., look out!

170
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:29,192
Alright.

171
00:14:32,135 --> 00:14:34,330
Oh dear, I've got to
put Asuka Jr. down somewhere.

172
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:45,263
Get down.

173
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,331
No way!

174
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:03,763
I need to borrow your bike!

175
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:04,538
Yes, sir.

176
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,435
Excuse me, what time is it?

177
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,071
Let's see... it's 8:50.

178
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:22,379
Thank you.

179
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,123
Hey... what was that?!

180
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:38,451
Darn!

181
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,936
Hold it!

182
00:15:48,752 --> 00:15:51,152
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

183
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,122
Tatsuo Ninomiya

184
00:15:56,537 --> 00:15:57,799
It's that kid's!

185
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,722
Hey, who's John?!

186
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,008
Hey! You idiot!

187
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:22,762
Phew. That was close.

188
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:30,872
St. Tail!

189
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,878
I'm not letting you get away!

190
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:40,261
I don't know why,
but I'm so happy.

191
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,388
Oh no... I've got to hurry!

192
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:55,199
That's... the train station.

193
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:15,849
Huh?

194
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:18,830
I want you to come to the airport.

195
00:17:19,536 --> 00:17:22,699
I can't, John. It will
just make things harder.

196
00:17:23,278 --> 00:17:26,975
John... so that means
it was his bicycle.

197
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:33,019
I didn't get my bike back,
but I'm glad I got to meet you.

198
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:34,461
I feel the same.

199
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,642
I think...

200
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:43,048
It's yours John!

201
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:44,386
But who brought it here?

202
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,532
Our prayers were answered.

203
00:17:48,204 --> 00:17:51,037
John, we'll meet again, won't we?

204
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,043
We will.

205
00:17:54,118 --> 00:17:57,519
I thought I'd never see
my bike again, but I did.

206
00:17:58,462 --> 00:18:00,760
So I know you
and I will meet again.

207
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:05,878
John!

208
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,019
That's nice.

209
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,208
St. Tail.

210
00:18:37,188 --> 00:18:38,485
Good morning!

211
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:43,127
Good morning!

212
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:46,366
Haneoka...

213
00:18:46,443 --> 00:18:48,274
What's the matter?
You look so depressed.

214
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:52,287
It's none of your business!

215
00:18:52,324 --> 00:18:52,959
What's with you?!

216
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,790
It wouldn't hurt you
to talk about it!

217
00:18:54,964 --> 00:18:57,125
Humph. It's only love.

218
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,938
Oh, so Asuka Jr. is
in love with somebody.

219
00:19:02,448 --> 00:19:03,437
Listen, you...!

220
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,914
We're gonna be late!

221
00:19:06,993 --> 00:19:07,823
Oh, no!
