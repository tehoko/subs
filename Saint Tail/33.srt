1
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:26,480
The stolen sword was...

2
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:28,024
...Kikuchiyo, which is as valuable
as the national treasure.

3
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,124
The thief hasn't gone too far yet.

4
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,199
Turn on the lights!

5
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:36,206
Right there!

6
00:00:40,014 --> 00:00:40,981
That's...!

7
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:42,581
That's the mysterious
thief, Mouse Kid!

8
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:45,016
Don't let him escape!

9
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:55,705
He's disappeared!

10
00:00:56,274 --> 00:00:57,901
Another famous
sword was stolen!

11
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:00,104
This is the sixth sword this month!

12
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:01,881
He's good... He's very good!

13
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:03,450
Now is not the time to admire him!

14
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,485
Find Mouse Kid and do it now!

15
00:01:05,657 --> 00:01:06,624
Yes, sir!

16
00:01:13,036 --> 00:01:17,370
A SWORDSWOMAN'S WISH!
TO STEAL THE EXCELLENT SWORD

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,738
...according to these calculations...

18
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:23,877
...x=2y.

19
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:26,791
I would like someone
to solve this problem.

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,920
Noriko, please solve it.

21
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:31,688
Noriko!

22
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:33,035
Yes!

23
00:01:35,074 --> 00:01:36,041
Well...

24
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:39,508
It's not like you...

25
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:41,979
...to daydream during class.

26
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:44,723
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:56,195
Noriko wasn't her usual self,
and she was absent-minded today.

28
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:59,073
It was strange...

29
00:01:59,482 --> 00:02:03,919
I guess she couldn't think
of anything but today's match.

30
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:06,757
She said she wanted
to win no matter what.

31
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:07,995
What do you mean?

32
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:10,900
Ten!

33
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:12,603
One!

34
00:02:13,438 --> 00:02:14,405
Two!

35
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,008
Three!

36
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:17,512
Four!

37
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:19,214
Five!

38
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,517
Six!

39
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:22,551
- Seven!
- Noriko is considered...

40
00:02:22,655 --> 00:02:24,179
- Eight!
-...a talented martial artist...

41
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,258
- Nine!
-...from St. Paulia's School.

42
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:26,326
- Ten!
- Her family has had a Dojo...

43
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,860
- One! Two!
-...for a long time.

44
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,924
- Three!
- If I remember correctly...

45
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:32,025
- Four!
-...her grandfather, Saburota...

46
00:02:32,137 --> 00:02:33,627
-Five!
-...is the owner of a Dojo.

47
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:35,574
- Six!
- He's considered...

48
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,870
- Seven!
-...the best in town.

49
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,541
- Eight!
- A man named...

50
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:40,309
- Nine! Ten!
-... Kumayama challenged him.

51
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:42,220
Ten more!

52
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:48,587
If I win, I'll take
the famous sword, Munemasa.

53
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,933
The famous sword
Munemasa...

54
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,833
...is an heirloom
in Noriko's family...

55
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,868
...which has been passed on
from generation to generation.

56
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:01,920
Grandpa!

57
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:03,121
Grandpa!

58
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:07,584
A promise is a promise.
I'll take Munemasa.

59
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:14,630
Since then her grandfather
hasn't been well...

60
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:18,676
...and keeps saying
that he is sorry to his ancestors.

61
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,085
Today, Noriko is going to compete
against Mr. Kumayama.

62
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:29,329
That means she is looking
to avenge her grandfather.

63
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:33,429
Kumayama... Kumayama...

64
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:34,698
Oh, that must be it!

65
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:40,680
KUMAYAMA DOJO

66
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,916
If I win, you promise that you'll
return the Munemasa to me, right?

67
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:50,599
I consider myself an honorable
martial artist. I don't lie.

68
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,866
AIthough I don't think
I'll lose to little girl like you.

69
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,816
No time limit.
One shot decides.

70
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,853
Bow to each other!

71
00:04:13,342 --> 00:04:14,400
Begin!

72
00:04:24,962 --> 00:04:26,088
Kote (hand)!

73
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:27,186
Men (head)!

74
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:38,173
Hang in there, Noriko!

75
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:10,762
Do (Chest)!

76
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,834
Count "Do!"

77
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,840
Great! Mr. Kumayama!

78
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,023
Wait a minute!

79
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:25,996
Noriko won the match!

80
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:27,123
Who are you?

81
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:30,534
I saw you cheat!

82
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,139
What did you say?!

83
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:33,369
What?!

84
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:35,070
Stop it, Meimi!

85
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:37,912
But...!

86
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:39,944
Thank you very much.

87
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:42,418
Noriko!

88
00:05:45,232 --> 00:05:47,962
Aren't you frustrated, Noriko?!

89
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:50,230
No matter how you lose
the match, a loss is a loss.

90
00:05:50,374 --> 00:05:51,500
No way...!

91
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:55,946
My grandfather always says so.

92
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,648
But if that's true...!

93
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,925
Thank you, Meimi.

94
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,622
Noriko...

95
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:07,827
See you, then.

96
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:14,845
She is, indeed,
Saburota's granddaughter...

97
00:06:14,982 --> 00:06:17,109
I almost lost.

98
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:20,144
Before she
challenges me again...

99
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:23,691
... I'll have to hide
the Munemasa somewhere...

100
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,741
That's my chair, Mouse Kid.

101
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,755
It's a good sword.
We can sell it at a high price.

102
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:44,386
Don't say something so stupid.

103
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,893
I earned this sword
after I fought with Saburota.

104
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:50,001
I will never sell it.

105
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,376
I know that!

106
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,575
Because of this sword,
I'm rising in rank...

107
00:06:57,955 --> 00:06:59,752
...and the number
of my students has increased.

108
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:03,090
You're an important
customer to me.

109
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:06,161
I won't steal the sword from you.

110
00:07:06,503 --> 00:07:07,834
And what do you have today?

111
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:16,140
This.

112
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:19,416
That's one of the best swords,
Kikuchiyo, isn't it?

113
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:25,928
Do you like it?

114
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:31,374
Another fantastic sword
is added to my collection.

115
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:34,144
All of it is due to me.

116
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:35,848
I know that.

117
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,200
This is what I promised you.
Please examine it.

118
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,513
That Kumayama is really unfair!

119
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,320
"I couldn't get Munemasa back.
Grandfather, I'm sorry."

120
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,721
What?

121
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,802
Noriko came by to say
that prayer a little while ago.

122
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:09,736
It's time for St. Tail, isn't it?

123
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,039
Let's get the fabulous
Munemasa sword back ourselves.

124
00:08:14,552 --> 00:08:15,780
You're right!

125
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:19,785
St. Tail will teach that fake
marital artist a harsh lesson!

126
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,698
"Tonight I'm taking
the fabulous Munemasa sword...

127
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,538
...from the Kumayama Dojo.

128
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:31,804
-St. Tail"

129
00:08:33,617 --> 00:08:35,107
What?!

130
00:08:42,098 --> 00:08:45,431
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

131
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:51,780
One!

132
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:55,320
Two!

133
00:08:57,592 --> 00:09:00,322
Three!

134
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,382
Be careful, Meimi.

135
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,016
It Iooks like...

136
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,593
... Kumayama has some sort
of connection to the Mouse Kid.

137
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:21,294
The Mouse Kid?!

138
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:22,824
Isn't he the one...

139
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:24,994
...who's stolen many swords
from different places?

140
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,168
After hearing about
St. Tail's warning note...

141
00:09:29,412 --> 00:09:31,676
...he may set something up.

142
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,009
Don't worry!

143
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:36,585
Sacred tail doesn't
lose to a mouse thief!

144
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:38,487
I'm going to teach him
a lesson using Kumayama!

145
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,254
I'm counting on you!

146
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:46,000
May the blessings
of God be with us.

147
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:07,372
Please calm down,
Mr. Kumayama.

148
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:09,135
How can I calm down?!

149
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,748
The Munemasa
has been targeted!

150
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:14,111
Don't worry.
Our security is perfect.

151
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,318
We'll protect your Munemasa.

152
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:20,262
I'm counting on you, Asuka Jr.

153
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:26,000
I can't show weakness
in front of my students.

154
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:31,136
Being a top martial artist
puts a lot of pressure on you.

155
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:34,053
It's almost time.

156
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:36,717
I'm going to check
on our security guards.

157
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:43,733
Everything is going
according to my plan.

158
00:10:44,173 --> 00:10:46,437
Bring it on, St. Tail!

159
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,699
Is there anything unusual?

160
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:06,035
Not so far!

161
00:11:06,577 --> 00:11:07,839
Huh? That's a...?

162
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,094
Oh, it's just a balloon.

163
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:21,323
Wait! It may be
a trap set by St. Tail!

164
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:37,187
Hey!

165
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,557
Like I said, it's just a balloon.

166
00:11:43,907 --> 00:11:45,374
What's this?!

167
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:46,704
Asuka Jr.!

168
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:49,447
Asuka Jr.! Please help us!

169
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,016
We're stuck in this stuff.

170
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,981
What are you guys doing?!

171
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:56,526
I can't get up!

172
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:58,956
It's super glue!

173
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,291
Let's help Asuka Jr.!

174
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:08,336
St. Tail!

175
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,778
Hey, wait a minute!

176
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:23,306
Good evening!

177
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:25,700
Everyone! Attack!

178
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:35,619
It's...

179
00:12:37,532 --> 00:12:40,000
...Show...

180
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:42,902
...Time!

181
00:12:46,714 --> 00:12:48,306
What are you guys doing?!

182
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,909
We can't control our movements.

183
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:55,185
It's St. Tail's line dance!

184
00:12:55,796 --> 00:12:59,061
It's a little disappointing
because we have all men.

185
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:04,343
You...!

186
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:26,545
I TOOK THE FAMOUS SWORD
MUNEMASA INDEED. -ST. TAIL

187
00:13:33,894 --> 00:13:36,055
Oh, no! It's too late!

188
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:39,792
Shoot!

189
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:42,172
I'm going to catch her!

190
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,717
It's my decoy.

191
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:53,850
I'm aware of your plan.

192
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,431
You're the mysterious thief
Mouse Kid, aren't you?!

193
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,745
I will take the famous
Munemasa sword!

194
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:09,011
That's Mouse Kid!

195
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,518
Wait a minute!

196
00:14:14,797 --> 00:14:17,493
I get it. The one that
flew away was a decoy...

197
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,630
Oh, boy...

198
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:21,773
Who would have imagined
that two thieves were after it...?

199
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:23,633
- Let's go after them!
- Yes, sir!

200
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:42,071
Listen! Mouse Kid
has the Munemasa!

201
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:43,471
Let's spread out
and search for it!

202
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:44,771
Yes, sir!

203
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:50,484
But where did St. Tail go?

204
00:14:59,505 --> 00:15:01,268
Hey! Did you find him?

205
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:02,467
No...

206
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,904
Where did he go?

207
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:06,340
- Let's search over there, too.
- Yeah.

208
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:17,892
Mr. Kumayama...?

209
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,459
Why?

210
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:21,037
Good job.

211
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:22,503
Mouse Kid.

212
00:15:29,656 --> 00:15:31,556
It went well, didn't it?

213
00:15:32,294 --> 00:15:34,592
You had me
steal the Munemasa...

214
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,823
...to keep it from...

215
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,526
...Saburota
and his granddaughter.

216
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:43,140
And because you dealt
with both St. Tail and Mouse Kid...

217
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,810
...your reputation will increase.

218
00:15:46,552 --> 00:15:47,849
Good plan...

219
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,821
I couldn't have done it
without you.

220
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:54,653
So give me back the Munemasa.

221
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,793
Where's the money
you promised me?

222
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:01,276
All right.

223
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:09,916
I look forward
to working together again.

224
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:12,085
Same here.

225
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,547
Mouse Kid! Hey!

226
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,117
I'll take the Munemasa!

227
00:16:28,356 --> 00:16:31,519
I'll make a lot of money
selling this sword!

228
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:33,924
You betrayed me! You!

229
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:39,932
Both of you!

230
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:41,067
Don't move!

231
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:44,875
Make sure you catch him!

232
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,720
Wait! Mouse Kid!

233
00:17:02,614 --> 00:17:04,411
He's persistent!

234
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:09,191
Look out!

235
00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:27,886
How about that?
It's a simple trick using an illusion.

236
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:33,894
St. Tail...!

237
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:46,351
I'll take the fabulous
Munemasa sword!

238
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:50,688
St. Tail!

239
00:17:54,503 --> 00:17:56,528
Hey, you! Give up!

240
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,235
Get off of me!

241
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,313
No way!

242
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,560
Captain. At Kumayama's Dojo...

243
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,024
...we found the fabulous
Kikuchiyo sword...

244
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,565
...which was stolen the other day.

245
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:15,195
All right.

246
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:17,467
Come, Mouse Kid.

247
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:19,534
Kumayama, you, too.

248
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:25,920
You caught two
bad guys by yourself.

249
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,721
Like father, like son!

250
00:18:29,028 --> 00:18:30,154
Oh, well...

251
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:34,959
I was just chasing St. Tail.

252
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:53,665
Grandpa! The Munemasa...!
The Munemasa is back!
