1
00:00:06,938 --> 00:00:11,432
I've caught you, St. Tail!
You won't get away this time!

2
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:19,320
Meimi!

3
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,292
Asuka Jr.

4
00:00:22,268 --> 00:00:26,705
So you were the thief, St. Tail.

5
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,177
You had me fooled all this time.

6
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:35,620
No, no. I wasn't fooling you!

7
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:40,593
All this time I just couldn't
get myself to tell you the truth!

8
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,070
A dream?

9
00:00:49,853 --> 00:00:53,118
Ruby, I just can't get myself
to tell him...

10
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:59,629
...that I'm St. Tail.

11
00:01:02,978 --> 00:01:07,938
I definitely can't tell him. And I
definitely can't let him catch me.

12
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:13,955
A FAKE CALLING CARD!?
THE SECRET OF THE PERFUME TRAP!

13
00:01:17,606 --> 00:01:18,937
I'm leaving!

14
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,821
Addressed to me?

15
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:30,823
Good morning!

16
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:37,871
Is it my imagination? Aren't the girls
putting extra effort into their hair?

17
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:40,272
Yep. And here's why!

18
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:46,254
A cosmetic company is looking for
a girl to introduce their new shampoo.

19
00:01:46,694 --> 00:01:51,256
Sawatari says that he's taking
a photo to compete in the event.

20
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:53,061
I see.

21
00:01:53,307 --> 00:01:55,468
Well, just sit and watch.

22
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:59,977
These hands will be sending
a supermodel into the world.

23
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:04,120
Meimi, look this way!

24
00:02:04,895 --> 00:02:08,592
Nothing different.
Just doing his same old stunts.

25
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:10,866
It's Meimi, after all.

26
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:14,543
How can you fight it?
She's got beautiful hair.

27
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:18,942
St. Tail's hair is
a hundred times prettier.

28
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,521
You don't change either, do you?

29
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:26,329
What's that?

30
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,471
Speak of the devil!
It's a notice from St. Tail!

31
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,304
What will it be this time?

32
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:35,911
-Let me have a look!
-What are you doing?

33
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:42,385
"Tomorrow night I will be stealing
the Parfum Takarada Special. -St. Tail"

34
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:47,830
-She's going after some perfume?
-So that's the next caper.

35
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:53,811
What's this supposed to mean? I didn 't
send this notice. Who could it be?

36
00:02:57,161 --> 00:03:00,324
Why are you in such deep prayer?

37
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:05,297
You look very depressed.

38
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:09,279
I have just lost my father
in an accident.

39
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:11,877
I'm very sorry to hear that.

40
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:14,250
My father was a perfumer.

41
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,622
He developed fragrances
for perfumes, didn't he?

42
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:23,271
Yes. Before his death, he mentioned
a new perfume that was completed.

43
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:26,207
And he was very happy about it.

44
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:29,213
A perfume? Could it be--?

45
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:34,689
But just before it was to be completed,
he got into a car accident.

46
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:41,168
When Father died, he had
a notebook clenched in his hand.

47
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:45,280
The notebook contained the formula
for his new perfume.

48
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,116
Your father passionately loved
his work until the very last moment.

49
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:55,595
Yes, but the final ingredient
wasn't written in the notes.

50
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:59,900
Now that he's gone,
we don't have any idea what it was.

51
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:03,083
Oh, my. You don't have a single clue?

52
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:07,318
The last entry in the notebook
was "Earring of Snow."

53
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:10,029
But it was written like a secret code.

54
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:13,992
It's probably a flower
that blossoms in the winter.

55
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,971
Were you in deep prayer trying
to find out what it is?

56
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:23,884
Oh, no! I will definitely complete
Father's perfume on my own.

57
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:26,924
That's not what is troubling me.

58
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:33,905
I ask for God's help,
for the sake of my brother.

59
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:35,910
Your brother?

60
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:41,415
After Father's death, my brother
has become a different person.

61
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:46,824
He doesn't care about the perfume,
only about how much he can sell it for.

62
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:50,270
He is planning an outrageous scheme!

63
00:04:57,824 --> 00:04:59,485
This is the greenhouse.

64
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:04,357
This is where we raise flowers and
concoct ingredients for the perfume.

65
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:10,206
And this is the Parfum
Takarada Special, Asuka Jr.

66
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:15,176
We haven't mass-produced it yet,
so this is the only bottle.

67
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:18,882
For St. Tail to crave this,
she must see its true value.

68
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:22,567
Please leave the security to us.

69
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:27,065
Let's make the security a big thing,
as extravagant as possible.

70
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:30,775
As extravagant as possible?

71
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:36,716
I'm selling this to a major
manufacturer in three days.

72
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,695
It would be a disaster
if it gets stolen before that.

73
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,737
Yes.

74
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:48,710
In any case, it's a product
that's sure to be a big hit.

75
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:50,715
I see.

76
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:56,655
It'll be a smash hit with the help
of our little St. Tail.

77
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,067
A St. Tail brand perfume?

78
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:07,574
That fake notice was probably sent by
Miss Takarada's brother to Asuka Jr.

79
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:09,582
What's that?

80
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:15,198
He is trying to sell an incomplete
perfume formula for a high price...

81
00:06:15,437 --> 00:06:20,431
...by advertising it as "a perfume
worth being stolen by St. Tail."

82
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,444
What a dirty trick.

83
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:26,086
His sister, Yuriko,
says that she's against...

84
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:29,954
...sending the incomplete formula
out on the market...

85
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,600
...and deceiving people
with false advertisement.

86
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,433
I'd really like to help her.

87
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:38,703
Meimi, you'll do it, won't you?

88
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:43,716
OK. Let's make the best
of that fake calling card!

89
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:49,223
Well, now, let's begin
our long homeroom.

90
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:51,699
Oh, the petals are falling!

91
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,773
-What's wrong?
-The cherry blossoms in the yard.

92
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:57,277
Will the flowers hold
until school is out?

93
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,916
Sister!

94
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:02,146
Oh, my goodness. Well, all right.

95
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:08,230
We'll have you go out to play in
the yard for this hour of the class.

96
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:12,704
Just for this hour now!

97
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:16,915
Really, they're supposed
to be junior high students.

98
00:07:17,155 --> 00:07:20,090
Is it the season
or do they just want to play?

99
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,699
Sawatari, how could you bring
your camera at a time like this?

100
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:32,471
You amateur, it's in
beautiful scenery like this...

101
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:35,208
...when true beauty
can be photographed.

102
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,356
Hey, Meimi!

103
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:39,527
The same routine.

104
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:44,492
Where's the difference?
Meimi looks the same to me.

105
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:49,172
-Meimi, come, come!
-What is it?

106
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:56,050
What's wrong with me?
That's totally impossible!

107
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:58,320
Asuka Jr.

108
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,927
What is it?

109
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:04,471
There's something I want
to ask you, all right?

110
00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:08,375
Do you know what the secret code
"Earring of Snow" means?

111
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:10,348
What's that?

112
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:14,855
Asuka Jr. knows a lot of things.
He just might know.

113
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:18,659
So winter flowers,
what kind are there?

114
00:08:18,906 --> 00:08:22,501
I don't know anything about flowers.

115
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,847
There's just one I've heard of.
When I was 5 years old, my mother...

116
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,219
Tell me!

117
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:36,495
I think it's a story that
goes back to the Creation.

118
00:08:36,873 --> 00:08:38,135
The Creation?

119
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:42,112
Well, a story that
goes way back in time.

120
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:48,090
Everything in nature
has a color, right?

121
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,092
Just as the sky is blue
and the clouds are gray.

122
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:55,032
Well, the snow went to see God...

123
00:08:55,541 --> 00:09:00,444
...and told him, "It's unfair
that I have no color."

124
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:07,057
God told the snow, "Ask a flower
to give you its color."

125
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:12,462
But there wasn't a single flower that
would give the cold snow its color.

126
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:14,370
How pitiful.

127
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:17,774
But, just as the snow was
about to give up...

128
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:22,512
...a flower came forth and said,
"You can have my white color."

129
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,954
Then what?

130
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:26,989
Since then, it's said that...

131
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:31,604
...the snow protects that small flower
during the winter.

132
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:37,372
That's got to be it!
What's the name of that flower?

133
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:41,325
I forgot.

134
00:09:42,564 --> 00:09:46,295
I know it was
a delicious-sounding name but...

135
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:50,371
Oh, boy! You're hopeless
at the crucial moment!

136
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:52,875
Careful!

137
00:10:06,877 --> 00:10:10,472
What are you all worked up over?
It's just a story.

138
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:15,348
I want to know about the flower
that is able to survive near snow!

139
00:10:15,593 --> 00:10:20,895
I can't tell him I'm St. Tail.
I definitely can't let him catch me!

140
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,871
Thank you. Forget about it!

141
00:10:26,848 --> 00:10:30,113
What was that all about?

142
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:45,878
I'm home.

143
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:50,788
Welcome home.
Meimi, come over here a bit.

144
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,789
What is it?

145
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:58,001
-Mother. Mother.
-What?

146
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,005
Here, Mother.

147
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,978
Strange. It's not my birthday or our
wedding anniversary, but a present?

148
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:08,914
Never mind, just open it.

149
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,033
What's this? You two are terrible!

150
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:21,841
It's my new magic trick.

151
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:25,783
Oh, you! Just look at this mess!

152
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:29,753
What? Snow? Snow!

153
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:32,465
Isn't it great?

154
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:38,443
Father, it's a great idea...

155
00:11:38,684 --> 00:11:43,383
...but isn't it
a bit off-season for snow?

156
00:11:43,627 --> 00:11:46,755
Maybe you're right.

157
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:52,301
Oh! What am I going to do?
The dinner has...

158
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,806
I'm sorry, Eimi.

159
00:12:01,394 --> 00:12:04,693
Meimi seemed depressed.
I was trying to cheer her up.

160
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:08,233
I know. She was moaning
in her sleep last night too.

161
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:10,738
I wonder if something
happened at school.

162
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:14,540
Don't worry.
She's our daughter after all.

163
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:17,277
She'll get herself back on her feet.

164
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:19,719
I hope you're right.

165
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,976
Ruby, well, it's time to work.

166
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:40,321
I won't, I won't...
I can't let him catch me!

167
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:45,002
Don't worry!
I'm just fine. I'll be back.

168
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,957
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

169
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:01,905
One!

170
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:05,178
Two!

171
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:09,452
Three!

172
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:27,147
Meimi, the flower that
Asuka Jr. was talking about...

173
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,291
...it's probably called the snow drop.

174
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,122
How did you find out?

175
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:37,565
It's the only winter flower
that has a delicious-sounding name.

176
00:13:38,077 --> 00:13:40,545
I see! Thanks, Seira!

177
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:46,550
May the blessings of God be with us.

178
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:57,737
The perfume in Mr. Takarada's hand
is St. Tail's target.

179
00:13:57,981 --> 00:14:02,680
-Let's keep the security tight.
-Yes, Asuka Jr.!

180
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:09,462
With this security alone, St. Tail
will be associated with this perfume...

181
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:15,301
...even if the notice is fake
and St. Tail doesn't show up.

182
00:14:15,782 --> 00:14:20,412
-Asuka Jr., this woman.
-Who are you?

183
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:23,122
Yuriko! I told you to get out!

184
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,066
Brother, please stop all this!

185
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:32,036
St. Tail!

186
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:36,509
Good evening!
Thank you for the invitation.

187
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,717
-Invitation?
-This can't be! The notice is a--

188
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:45,660
-Something wrong with the notice?
-Oh, nothing.

189
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:49,639
Why is the real St. Tail here?

190
00:14:50,214 --> 00:14:53,115
I'm the one that sent
the fake calling card out.

191
00:14:55,157 --> 00:14:58,058
- Darn it!
-Brother, wait!

192
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,260
You won't get away!

193
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:09,241
God sees through everything!
One! Two! Three!

194
00:15:20,906 --> 00:15:22,840
Hold it! That's--

195
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,978
-I'm leaving with the perfume!
-Hold it, St. Tail!

196
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:34,319
Who will let you get away with it?
Wait! Give that back!

197
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:36,396
There you go!

198
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:45,575
Asuka Jr., the perfume!
Get that perfume back for me!

199
00:15:46,388 --> 00:15:49,880
Mr. Takarada, it's time
for you to wake up!

200
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:53,291
What's going on here, St. Tail?

201
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:01,010
It's...

202
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,441
...Show...

203
00:16:05,624 --> 00:16:07,785
...Time!

204
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,704
Asuka Jr., this is...

205
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:21,674
What's happening?
The temperature is-- It's snowing!

206
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:24,117
Is it her famous illusion trick?

207
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:30,989
Stop! Father's flowers will die! Stop!

208
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:37,667
If the flowers die, we won't be able
to make the perfume! Please stop!

209
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:45,223
Brother, it's your fault. If Father's
flowers die, it's all your fault!

210
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,171
Yuriko, I understand.

211
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:55,708
Yuriko.

212
00:16:56,687 --> 00:17:00,350
You two will be able
to make a wonderful perfume...

213
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:03,063
...even without the use of my name.

214
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:06,996
What are you blabbering about?

215
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:10,971
Let's forget about it, Asuka Jr.

216
00:17:11,382 --> 00:17:13,942
But the perfume...

217
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:19,255
That calling card, I was the one
who sent it to you.

218
00:17:19,965 --> 00:17:25,699
Instead of completing the perfume,
all I thought of was how to sell it.

219
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:30,671
If St. Tail was after it, it would
become famous. That's why I...

220
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,352
What's that?

221
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:37,652
Asuka Jr., I should have gone
and told you of it sooner.

222
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:43,533
Snow?

223
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:49,446
No, they're white flowers!

224
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:59,361
The fragrance of this flower,
could it be...?

225
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:04,303
The final ingredient in the notebook,
"Earring of Snow," is this!

226
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,378
We can make it! Father's perfume!

227
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:10,489
Yuriko, let's try
to complete it together!

228
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:11,717
Brother!

229
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:19,898
St. Tail, come down here
and challenge me!

230
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:24,077
You had me fooled all along,
didn't you?

231
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:26,551
I didn't mean to fool you.

232
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:32,461
I can't say it with words.
I can't tell you.

233
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:37,536
Asuka Jr., I'm sorry
to have troubled you.

234
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:42,842
I'm glad it was stolen.
St. Tail has helped me to wake up.

235
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,823
Is that so?

236
00:18:54,277 --> 00:19:00,443
This puts me on the spot.
All because of St. Tail.

237
00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:13,867
No, not yet.
I can't afford to get caught yet.

238
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:17,417
I can't get caught.
