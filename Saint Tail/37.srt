1
00:00:04,902 --> 00:00:05,960
Your attention, please.

2
00:00:06,237 --> 00:00:09,866
This plane will be landing
within 20 minutes...

3
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:12,469
...at the New Tokyo
International Airport.

4
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,088
Who's that woman?

5
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:21,457
Tomoko Nagata,
she's 28 years old.

6
00:00:21,568 --> 00:00:23,593
A successful
detective in the U. S.

7
00:00:24,273 --> 00:00:26,332
She's so good
that she solved a case...

8
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:27,968
...which even
the FBI couldn't solve.

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,410
So why do we
have to meet her?

10
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:35,221
The mayor himself
invited her.

11
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:37,589
This means you may
finally lose your job...

12
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:39,625
...investigating St. Tail.

13
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,240
She must be a very
old-fashioned, homely...

14
00:00:45,348 --> 00:00:46,838
...and unpleasant woman.

15
00:00:47,185 --> 00:00:49,176
I'm sorry that I'm
an unpleasant woman.

16
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:07,416
PHANTASMAL MASTERPIECE!
A WOMAN DETECTIVE IS BACK

17
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,119
Do you know...

18
00:01:09,262 --> 00:01:11,093
...about the mysterious
thief St. Tail?

19
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,633
She uses magic freely...

20
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:16,540
...and she sends
a warning note prior to her crime.

21
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:19,803
No one knows her identity.

22
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:20,883
Right?

23
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:22,019
Impressive!

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,747
Then we can talk now.

25
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:25,723
I want to ask you
for your assistance...

26
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:27,260
...in catching St. Tail.

27
00:01:27,932 --> 00:01:31,766
I've assured you
that I'll catch her!

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes. I expect you
can catch her someday.

29
00:01:38,587 --> 00:01:40,612
But in this case...

30
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:43,659
...I think it's better
to ask this lovely lady.

31
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:47,295
I'm sorry...

32
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:50,539
...but I came back to Japan
on a personal matter.

33
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:52,573
Can you make any
arrangements to help us?

34
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:53,671
Excuse me.

35
00:01:56,757 --> 00:01:58,486
To-mo-ko!

36
00:02:00,196 --> 00:02:01,993
I can give you a ride.

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,827
I'm sorry...

38
00:02:03,938 --> 00:02:05,405
...that I can't assist you.

39
00:02:06,742 --> 00:02:08,004
That's all right.

40
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:11,348
I definitely will
arrest St. Tail.

41
00:02:11,552 --> 00:02:13,417
I'm the person
who will catch her!

42
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,854
Be quiet! This kind
of thing is done by age.

43
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:18,629
That's unfair! All of a sudden
you're motivated!

44
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:23,661
Tomoko has sparked
the detective fire in me!

45
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,045
It's nice to see a father
and son together.

46
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:27,948
By the way, Asuka Jr. ...

47
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:29,710
...you go to St. Paulia's, don't you?

48
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:31,649
What? How did you know?

49
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:33,687
Your uniform.

50
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,460
Say, could you show me
around the school?

51
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:38,092
Yeah...

52
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:43,405
The graph for y=2x
is a straight line...

53
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:45,107
...which runs through the origin.

54
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:48,485
I wonder what
happened to Asuka Jr.

55
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:51,557
He's healthy and has
never missed any classes.

56
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:54,501
He was summoned
by the mayor...

57
00:02:54,704 --> 00:02:56,228
...according to Takamiya.

58
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:58,841
That means it must have
something to do with St. Tail.

59
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:03,510
Hey, Asuka Jr. is...

60
00:03:03,622 --> 00:03:05,886
...walking with a really
beautiful woman!

61
00:03:06,194 --> 00:03:07,593
What?!

62
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:10,896
She's really beautiful!

63
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:13,801
I didn't know that he
likes older women.

64
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,172
What's going on?
Go back to your seats!

65
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:19,148
Oh, Nagata...?

66
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:21,646
Do you know her, Sister?

67
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:24,458
Yes. She was
the smartest student...

68
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:25,929
...in the history of this school.

69
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:27,090
If I remember correctly...

70
00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:29,226
...she went to a college in the U.S.

71
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:35,648
Do you know
about her, Seira?

72
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:36,981
I've heard rumors about her.

73
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:38,679
She was the famous daughter...

74
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,089
...of a rich family in this town.

75
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:42,562
On the hill from where
you can see the port...

76
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,428
...there is a big
European-style house.

77
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:46,395
You mean that
haunted house?

78
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:49,039
Yes. She used to live there.

79
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:51,510
But the people who
lived there are missing...

80
00:03:51,683 --> 00:03:52,707
...aren't they?

81
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:55,078
That's the rumor, but...

82
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,486
I've heard she's
a famous detective now.

83
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:01,529
What?! A detective?

84
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:12,117
Just beyond here, I've found
a really cute trinket store.

85
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:14,117
Let's go, Meimi?!

86
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:16,588
Yeah,
but I have homework...

87
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,327
Just a little peek.

88
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:22,405
Oh, it's Tomoko!

89
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:23,943
I wonder where she's going.

90
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:25,443
Let's follow her!

91
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:27,209
What?! But...!

92
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:29,118
- Don't worry!
- Wait!

93
00:04:34,368 --> 00:04:35,596
Where did she go?

94
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:38,541
Isn't this
the haunted house?

95
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:40,803
I've heard that a first-year
student in our school...

96
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:43,145
...heard a woman crying
in the middle of night.

97
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:44,220
Ryoko!

98
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:54,135
We met earlier.

99
00:04:54,675 --> 00:04:55,835
Well...

100
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:58,604
Tomoko Nagata.
Nice to meet you.

101
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:00,748
Yes. I'm Meimi Haneoka.

102
00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:03,948
A delicate
and beautiful hand...

103
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:05,892
People who have
hands like this...

104
00:05:06,065 --> 00:05:07,555
...are often magicians.

105
00:05:10,674 --> 00:05:11,698
Would you like to come in?

106
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:12,833
But...

107
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:15,774
Don't worry.

108
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,364
A lot of my memories
are from here.

109
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:30,003
In your eyes, this must
be like a haunted house.

110
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:31,572
Oh, no...!

111
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:33,510
They were
understanding parents.

112
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:36,212
When I said
I wanted to study abroad...

113
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:38,187
...they let me do it
without saying anything.

114
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:39,495
But...

115
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:43,763
Let's go upstairs!

116
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,109
It's beautiful!

117
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:53,753
I was always dreaming.

118
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:55,824
From here...
from this window...

119
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,756
...I wanted to fly away.

120
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,899
I wanted to go somewhere.

121
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:03,274
I didn't notice...

122
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:05,380
...my parents' love for me.

123
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:08,545
Your parents are...

124
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:11,953
Missing.
Since I went abroad.

125
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:14,064
Oh, I'm sorry.

126
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,327
There's no reason
to tell you these things.

127
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:18,296
Please forget it.

128
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:27,816
Excuse me...

129
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:30,991
I'm sorry
I came in without asking.

130
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,667
It brought back
a lot of memories, so...

131
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:34,569
Please stay
as long as you'd like.

132
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:38,302
To tell you the truth,
I don't deserve to be here.

133
00:06:39,015 --> 00:06:41,609
Well, would you
like to tell me why?

134
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:45,484
Revenge?

135
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:46,887
Yes.

136
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:48,631
The person
who is responsible...

137
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:49,723
...for my parents'
disappearance.

138
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:52,437
I only came back here
to get my revenge.

139
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,343
My parents were
art dealers in this town.

140
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:57,908
Art dealers?

141
00:06:58,154 --> 00:07:00,918
Those people
who sell pieces of art?

142
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:02,282
Yes.

143
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:11,437
My father was
strict but affectionate.

144
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:14,272
Mother was always
watching over me.

145
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,715
I was really happy.

146
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:19,953
The piece of art my parents
treasured most was...

147
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:22,831
...a picture titled
"Wings of Freedom."

148
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:25,304
But a man who wanted...

149
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,374
..."Wings of Freedom"
appeared one day.

150
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:30,340
Of course, my parents
turned down his offer.

151
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:34,119
But in the end,
they gave in to his enthusiasm...

152
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,056
...and they decided
to sell it to him.

153
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:39,154
My father though that
he would treasure the picture.

154
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:42,328
But the man betrayed
my father's trust.

155
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:46,036
He said the picture
he bought was a fake...

156
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,183
...and he sued my father.

157
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,543
No way!

158
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:51,982
Because my father
didn't have...

159
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:53,527
...any evidence
to prove otherwise...

160
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,298
...he had to pay a lot
of money and apologize.

161
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:59,871
Because of that he lost
credibility as an art dealer...

162
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:01,938
...and he lost everything.

163
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:03,579
That's why they disappeared.

164
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,252
As I was abroad...

165
00:08:06,856 --> 00:08:08,619
...I didn't know what was going on.

166
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:10,221
But I have always believed...

167
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,922
...that my parents were innocent.

168
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:16,570
But in order to prove it...

169
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:19,005
...I didn't know what I could do.

170
00:08:19,113 --> 00:08:20,478
That's why you
became a detective?

171
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:23,950
In order to become
strong and take revenge...

172
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:25,886
...I endured the difficult training.

173
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:32,093
I continued to investigate...

174
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:33,603
...the man who deceived...

175
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,107
...my parents.

176
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:37,838
And the man is...?

177
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,111
He's the owner
of Sugawara Industries...

178
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:42,213
...Ryosuke Sugawara.

179
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:44,892
She's going to steal?!
No way!

180
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:47,331
If she can prove
that Sugawara...

181
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:50,232
...has the real
"Wings of Freedom"...

182
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:53,836
...then she can prove
her parents' innocence.

183
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:56,877
No! She shouldn't do that!

184
00:08:57,323 --> 00:08:58,381
Meimi...

185
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,183
I'll steal the picture.

186
00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:03,222
I'll steal it
before Tomoko can...

187
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:05,969
...and reveal
Sugawara's crime!

188
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,733
Her revenge is meaningless.

189
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,404
No way...

190
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,067
Today I'd like to take you around,
away from the job.

191
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:24,441
Dad!

192
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,541
I don't think you've seen enough
with this boy as a guide.

193
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:31,619
This time I'd like to show you
an adult's hospitality...!

194
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,444
"I'm taking
'Wings of Freedom'...

195
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:49,557
...that's in the possession
of Mr. Ryosuke Sugawara.

196
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:50,648
-St. Tail"

197
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:53,191
- She is...!
- What's that?

198
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:05,754
The real "Wings of Freedom"
is in my possession?

199
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:06,882
Is that what you're saying?

200
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:08,018
You don't have it?

201
00:10:08,597 --> 00:10:09,894
That's silly!

202
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,160
I've always wanted that piece...

203
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:17,004
Because of that,
I once bought a counterfeit.

204
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,977
So you're saying
you don't have it.

205
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:23,519
Of course I don't have it.

206
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:27,520
I'm the one who wants
to know where it is!

207
00:10:29,104 --> 00:10:33,131
I've heard of
the mysterious thief St. Tail.

208
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:35,413
She must have
misunderstood something.

209
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,042
She is...

210
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:41,084
It's not like St. Tail to send
an inaccurate warning note.

211
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:45,097
You believe
that petty thief's words?

212
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:46,895
She isn't a petty thief.

213
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,803
What Asuka Jr. said is true.

214
00:10:51,248 --> 00:10:52,510
According to my research...

215
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:56,677
...St. Tail has never sent
an inaccurate warning note.

216
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:58,151
Not even once!

217
00:10:58,763 --> 00:11:02,028
If you let us search your house,
we can clear this up.

218
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:03,438
I must refuse!

219
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,107
Why?!

220
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,102
If you haven't done
anything wrong...

221
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,769
...it shouldn't be a problem.

222
00:11:09,217 --> 00:11:10,548
Because it isn't necessary.

223
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:11,980
You don't even
have any evidence.

224
00:11:14,595 --> 00:11:16,460
Chairman. It's almost time.

225
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:17,923
All right.

226
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:19,325
Detective Asuka.

227
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:20,961
I'll listen to your advice...

228
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:22,699
...and will let you
guard the outside.

229
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:24,342
Then we'll do so.

230
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,877
Isn't she that
art dealer's daughter?!

231
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,948
Yes. I had it confirmed...

232
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,788
...through an American
detective agency...

233
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:33,124
...and there's no doubt about it.

234
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:36,033
Apparently she's been
investigating you.

235
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:37,460
This isn't good.

236
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,007
If she finds out
I have the real picture...

237
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:41,201
Then...?

238
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,606
You don't even need to ask!

239
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:44,819
Yes, sir!

240
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,352
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

241
00:11:56,678 --> 00:11:57,838
One!

242
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,310
Two!

243
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:07,222
Three!

244
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,987
Be careful, Meimi.

245
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:23,651
We don't know
what Tomoko will do.

246
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:26,192
Don't worry! It'll be fine!

247
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:31,838
May the blessings
of God be with us.

248
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,458
Asuka Jr., where is
Detective Asuka?

249
00:12:38,894 --> 00:12:40,555
He told me
he had something...

250
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:41,689
...he needed to check...

251
00:12:42,502 --> 00:12:44,766
What is he going to do?

252
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:02,369
I suppose she gave up...

253
00:13:05,046 --> 00:13:06,775
Pretty impressive, St. Tail.

254
00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:18,365
I can't let you interfere
with my revenge.

255
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:22,936
Over there!

256
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:24,277
She's up in this tree!

257
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:26,080
Oh, no! How?!

258
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,793
Asuka Jr.!

259
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:35,029
Darn it! Never mind!
Let's move in!

260
00:13:35,206 --> 00:13:36,173
Yes!

261
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:40,610
What shall I do?!

262
00:13:46,162 --> 00:13:47,527
What's going on?!

263
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,101
You saved me!
Thank you, Asuka Jr.

264
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:28,133
This is the "Wings of Freedom"
you were looking for.

265
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:29,534
The real one.

266
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:32,510
It's the one
your father sold to me.

267
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:35,719
I prepared the counterfeit
and switched them.

268
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:38,585
Now that you've seen the picture
you were looking for...

269
00:14:38,732 --> 00:14:40,825
...you don't have
any regrets, do you?

270
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:42,928
The one who broke in
should have been St. Tail.

271
00:14:43,108 --> 00:14:44,439
So, even if you disappear...

272
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,477
...no one will suspect me.

273
00:14:48,518 --> 00:14:49,678
After the police leave...

274
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:52,688
...I'll decide how
you should disappear.

275
00:14:58,003 --> 00:15:00,267
We've made the police leave.

276
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:02,510
But the media is making a fuss.

277
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:06,107
I guess it would be better
to give them an explanation.

278
00:15:06,588 --> 00:15:07,816
Let's have a press conference.

279
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:10,594
This must be it.

280
00:15:15,138 --> 00:15:16,571
St. Tail...!

281
00:15:20,414 --> 00:15:21,438
Why?

282
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:23,915
You know that I set you up.

283
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:34,567
Oh, no...!

284
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:37,173
Let go! Let go of my hand!

285
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:38,482
Let go!

286
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,782
I can't do that!

287
00:15:46,065 --> 00:15:47,794
You almost did it, didn't you?!

288
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:49,760
Wait!

289
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,814
St. Tail...!

290
00:15:58,156 --> 00:16:00,750
I'm sorry, but I can't
give this picture to you.

291
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:03,532
Why not?!

292
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:06,497
You shouldn't steal!

293
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:07,596
Ever!

294
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,647
Asuka Jr.!
Where are you?!

295
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:13,645
Over here! Here!

296
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:36,994
It's...

297
00:16:38,202 --> 00:16:40,261
...Show...

298
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:42,800
...Time!

299
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:03,344
Hold on!

300
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,127
A thief by the name of St. Tail...

301
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:15,499
...seems to have
been misinformed.

302
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:17,677
Both six years ago and today...

303
00:17:17,848 --> 00:17:19,406
...I've been a victim.

304
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:22,686
You don't really have
"Wings of Freedom," do you?

305
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:24,150
Of course not.

306
00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:25,725
If you have any doubt...

307
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,287
...please go ahead and search
my house or my company.

308
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:38,409
That's a nice touch, Tajima...

309
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,960
I, Ryosuke Sugawara,
swear to God...

310
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:46,633
...that I am innocent!

311
00:17:51,948 --> 00:17:54,610
It's the real
"Wings of Freedom"!

312
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:59,425
- What?!
- Please explain this!

313
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,657
I don't know!
I don't know anything!

314
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:03,002
Mr. Sugawara.

315
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:05,798
Please come with us.

316
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:09,409
Have you discussed this
with the mayor?

317
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,407
Maybe you should
have a discussion...

318
00:18:11,553 --> 00:18:12,850
...with your conscience.

319
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,988
We've uncovered
a few things about you.

320
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,028
The materials she
gave us helped a lot.

321
00:18:20,805 --> 00:18:23,330
You'll have a lot of time
to tell us your story.

322
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,684
Thank you, St. Tail.

323
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:33,151
I heard that
Sugawara admitted...

324
00:18:33,297 --> 00:18:35,390
...deceiving your parents.

325
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:37,459
My dad was quite pleased.

326
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,336
Thank you for everything.

327
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:41,735
Please thank your father for me.

328
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,047
I will.

329
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,486
Meimi...

330
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:03,556
Hang in there.

331
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:05,685
I'm cheering
for you from America.

332
00:19:09,435 --> 00:19:10,959
What's the connection
between you?

333
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:13,336
We're best friends.

334
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,643
I didn't know... Hey!

335
00:19:16,082 --> 00:19:18,107
You don't understand.
Guys don't!

336
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:20,486
Wait! Hey, Meimi!
