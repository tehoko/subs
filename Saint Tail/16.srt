1
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,845
We haven't dined out for a while.

2
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:22,616
Let's make the best of it
by eating something great.

3
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,298
But there's a long line everywhere.

4
00:00:25,502 --> 00:00:27,766
Leave it to me! I know a place.

5
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:31,737
Well, here we are.

6
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:34,676
Tsujimoto Mansion? It looks pricey.

7
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:38,186
-Don't worry. Father's paying.
-What?

8
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:47,840
Are you sure it's okay?

9
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:53,281
I came here a few years ago.
Their rice gruel is delicious!

10
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:56,253
Reasonable prices, nice owner.

11
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,000
But something's strange.
Did they redecorate?

12
00:01:02,945 --> 00:01:07,609
I'm sorry, but we don't take
customers without reservations.

13
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:12,657
I don't remember needing one.
Isn't the chef Mr. Tsujimoto?

14
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:16,563
That is correct,
but the owner has changed.

15
00:01:17,408 --> 00:01:21,469
I'm Ohkura, the owner. Is there
something I can do for you?

16
00:01:21,684 --> 00:01:24,414
Is it true you need
a reservation to eat here?

17
00:01:24,957 --> 00:01:30,862
We only prepare meals for
three groups of customers per day.

18
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,664
So we refuse those
with no reservations.

19
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:36,071
That's why there's no line.

20
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:41,549
If you want to eat here, please make
a reservation and come again.

21
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:43,726
And when would that be?

22
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:45,988
Probably about three years.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,159
-Three years?
-We look forward to your visit.

24
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:56,284
That owner has such a rude attitude!

25
00:01:56,488 --> 00:02:02,188
Some cuisine critic must have praised
them and it's gone to their heads!

26
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:04,060
Well, well....

27
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,043
Let's get ahold of our feelings.

28
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,993
STEAL THE CHINESE IRON CHEF

29
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:23,469
Good morning!

30
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,669
That place has the greatest sauce!

31
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:29,045
-It's delicious!
-What's this?

32
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:33,016
A new octopus fritter shop
near the train station.

33
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,963
We're discussing whether that one
or the one near the park is better.

34
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:42,408
-What do you think?
-Maybe the one near the park.

35
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,080
See, I told you! That's a taste
that's hard to come by.

36
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,556
Since we've all agreed...

37
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:53,325
...let's stop by there after
school for a small snack.

38
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:56,869
How can you talk about that
so early in the morning?

39
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:00,947
-Something's wrong with your stomachs.
-What did you say?

40
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:06,114
Aren't I right? You're all going
to end up with faces like this:

41
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:10,929
How rude! And you're taking
forever to catch St. Tail!

42
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,471
Now you've said it!

43
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:15,510
You don't know if
they're friends or not.

44
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,392
Wasn't that Miss Sato?

45
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:32,567
Yes. She came to ask us
for help with her grandmother.

46
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:37,848
Her grandmother has been in the
hospital for a very long time.

47
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,457
Lately she's lost her appetite
and can't get out of bed.

48
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:47,166
Feeling sorry for her, Miss Sato
asked what she wanted to eat.

49
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:51,374
There was something she wanted
to eat again while she was alive.

50
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:55,355
-What could it be?
-Rice gruel.

51
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:57,294
-Rice gruel?
-Yes.

52
00:03:57,502 --> 00:04:00,801
It's an unforgettable dish
an old boyfriend made.

53
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,003
The story goes back to when
the grandmother was young.

54
00:04:05,218 --> 00:04:08,813
She fell in love with a young chef.

55
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:11,756
But they were destined
to be torn apart.

56
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:17,192
Goodbye. My parents have decided
on a fiance I am to wed.

57
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:20,504
Chiyo!

58
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:21,876
Ajinosuke!

59
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:24,350
Chiyo!

60
00:04:25,793 --> 00:04:27,317
Chiyo!

61
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,760
Ajinosuke!

62
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,233
Chiyo!

63
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:45,086
That was the last time she saw him.

64
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,063
Recently she found out that
he became a famous chef...

65
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,747
...and opened a restaurant here.

66
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:58,149
But the grandmother is in no
condition to leave the hospital.

67
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,622
For her sake...

68
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,697
...Miss Sato kept going
to the restaurant.

69
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,370
But she hasn 't been able to meet him.

70
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:07,338
That's just terrible.

71
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:11,311
No, the one who 's terrible
is the restaurant owner.

72
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:15,790
Business has been bad
since the new owner took it over.

73
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:19,488
He's gone against every
wish the chef has.

74
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:24,232
He's even made sure that this story
hasn't reached the chef's ears.

75
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:26,708
Do you mean Tsujimoto Mansion?

76
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:32,590
That's right. The chef is Ajinosuke
Tsujimoto, the Chinese lron Chef.

77
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:35,794
But how do you know
of the restaurant?

78
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:37,494
Just a tiny incident.

79
00:05:37,707 --> 00:05:41,234
The grandmother's wish is
to eat his cooking, but....

80
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:43,912
She really wants to see him.

81
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,214
Leave it to me!
St. Tail will make it happen.

82
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:59,570
Those girls only think about eating.
They have no sex appeal. What?

83
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:05,792
-Asuka, let's stop here before we go!
-Hey, guys.

84
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:10,662
-Look! It's a message from St. Tail!
-What?

85
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:17,409
"Tonight I will be stealing
the Chinese Iron Chef. -St. Tail"

86
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,892
Didn't think St. Tail was
a gourmet fan, did you, Asuka?

87
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:24,589
Sorry, guys. See you tomorrow!

88
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,261
You're saying that St. Tail's
going to steal the chef?

89
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,764
Well, that is a great honor.

90
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:46,204
Don't joke. You will cooperate
with us in her arrest, right?

91
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:50,408
Yes, most certainly.
Let me introduce you. Tsujimoto.

92
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:55,326
This is the Chinese Iron Chef
himself, Ajinosuke Tsujimoto.

93
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:58,400
This is Asuka Jr.

94
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:02,302
A pleasure. I am guarding you
from St. Tail today.

95
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,079
St. Tail?

96
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:07,014
Yes. Tonight, please do as I ask.

97
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:15,236
A master chef.

98
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:25,290
You little idiot.

99
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,910
Here.

100
00:07:37,552 --> 00:07:39,986
Thank you very much!

101
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:43,525
-Delicious!
-Your name is Asuka, right?

102
00:07:43,732 --> 00:07:47,133
-Yes.
-Is St. Tail really going to--?

103
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:52,101
Yes, but there's nothing to worry
about. I'm going to get her for sure.

104
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:58,048
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:23,909
Dad! What are you doing!

106
00:08:24,114 --> 00:08:25,809
That's my line!

107
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:28,111
I came after St. Tail.

108
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:31,086
-St. Tail is coming here?
-Yeah.

109
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:34,265
-That's not good.
-What's wrong?

110
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:38,738
-You know of the Washington Treaty?
-Washington Treaty?

111
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:43,212
Oh, it's to protect animals
like koalas and pandas...

112
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,945
...from bad hunters, isn't it?

113
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,118
It forbids buying and selling
protected animals...

114
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:51,926
...and punishes poachers.

115
00:08:52,138 --> 00:08:57,542
Right. And the owner of this
restaurant is breaking the treaty.

116
00:08:57,849 --> 00:09:01,512
They're running a black market
of protected animals.

117
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:05,318
-A black market?
-Be quiet!

118
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:07,727
Did you get the evidence?

119
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:11,669
Can't you tell by looking
at this outfit? Kids!

120
00:09:11,878 --> 00:09:13,675
Why'd I have to meet you?

121
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:17,545
If you've got a problem,
tell it to St. Tail!

122
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,521
Is something the matter?

123
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:23,226
Oh, it's nothing.

124
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:25,869
Ouch!

125
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,239
Dad, I'll remember this!

126
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:32,851
It's nothing.

127
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:54,764
Meimi isn't coming down?

128
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:57,332
She's got a ton of homework.

129
00:09:57,739 --> 00:10:01,266
I was going to teach Meimi
some card tricks.

130
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:06,250
No, you don't. You're trying to get
Meimi to take after you again!

131
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,726
What's wrong with that?
She has talented hands, like me.

132
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,696
What? She got her talent from me.

133
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,864
As usual, they're getting along fine.

134
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:26,060
Ruby, be a good girl now.

135
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,583
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

136
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:47,400
One!

137
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:51,008
Two!

138
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:55,114
Three!

139
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:13,554
Be careful. There are many other
bad rumors about Tsujimoto Mansion.

140
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:15,160
Don't worry, I know!

141
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:21,132
May the blessings of God be with us.

142
00:11:44,824 --> 00:11:48,954
-What's with all the police?
-St. Tail is supposed to come.

143
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,659
St. Tail? Then today's deal is--?

144
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,003
Don't worry.
Her target is the chef.

145
00:11:56,214 --> 00:12:00,913
And don't you think a racket
like that is to our advantage?

146
00:12:01,124 --> 00:12:03,251
Hurry and sit.

147
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,763
-Who are they?
-Today's customers.

148
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:11,737
-Are there others?
-This is all.

149
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:16,782
Then please close the shutters
until the meal ends.

150
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:50,550
I thought so. Just chickens.

151
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:57,961
Please enjoy this evening's feast.

152
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,645
What's this? A blackout?

153
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:06,719
-Turn the lights on!
-I can't! They won't go on!

154
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:10,925
The dinner will be put off
for another day!

155
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:14,160
Where are you, St. Tail?

156
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:17,104
Chef, don't let go of my hand!

157
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,716
That's the chef.

158
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:34,900
It's showtime!

159
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:55,155
What are these things?!

160
00:13:55,692 --> 00:13:59,128
Chef! Take refuge in
the storage room! This way!

161
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:04,239
You won't escape.

162
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:07,646
Oh, no!

163
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:11,581
That's far enough, St. Tail!

164
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:15,156
You thought you cornered me,
but now I've got you!

165
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:19,769
Imagine catching St. Tail in
a place like this! What luck!

166
00:14:30,296 --> 00:14:34,130
One! Two! Three!

167
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:55,203
Are the animals all right?

168
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:59,682
The animals--
I mean, is the chef all right?

169
00:15:00,258 --> 00:15:03,386
The chef is fine as of now.

170
00:15:03,664 --> 00:15:06,360
"I'll be taking the Iron Chef.
-St. Tail"

171
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:08,429
Darn!

172
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:20,188
This is a baby bald eagle
illegally imported into Japan!

173
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:25,840
This is....

174
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:30,674
A lesser panda!

175
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:38,124
That was wise of you to camouflage
these protected animals.

176
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:41,396
What are you talking about?

177
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:45,511
Cut the act.
You're under arrest, Ohkura.

178
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,489
What will you do with me?

179
00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:00,105
-It's not me who wants to see you.
-Then who?

180
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:07,647
Your girlfriend from 50 years ago.

181
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:20,909
This is....

182
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:54,755
Here you are.

183
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,441
It's the same taste as
50 years ago, Ajinosuke.

184
00:17:06,048 --> 00:17:07,675
Chiyo.

185
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:14,283
It's as if it were only yesterday.
The first time I met you, that is.

186
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:25,073
Excuse me.
Will you dance with me?

187
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:27,620
Yes.

188
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:50,092
Did you see today's paper? The animals
were returned to their homeland.

189
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:54,071
And Ohkura and the others
were arrested. Case closed!

190
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,274
I wonder what happened to the chef.
Tsujimoto Mansion was closed.

191
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,288
-Are you interested?
-Of course!

192
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:06,766
Chinese Food: Shanghai Tei

193
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:11,302
Seira, I'm really not
in the mood for noodles.

194
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:13,983
Isn't it Meimi and Seira?

195
00:18:14,421 --> 00:18:17,686
-Asuka Jr.!
-I was thinking of having a meal.

196
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:21,422
I know the owner here.
Are you two going in?

197
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,198
I'll be passing this one up.
See you later!

198
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,401
-Seira....
-How about you?

199
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:37,821
Welcome! Oh, it's you.

200
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:42,029
-What does that mean?
-Is this a date with your girlfriend?

201
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:44,236
No, it's nothing like that!

202
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:49,212
It's empty as usual. At this rate,
you'll close down in no time.

203
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:53,419
Maybe I'll advertise around
town for you. The owner is--

204
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:58,129
-Don't do anything of the sort!
-Yes. I'm sorry.

205
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:00,403
That's....

206
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,521
-Here you go.
-Eat! The rice gruel here is the best!

207
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:16,775
-Delicious!
-Didn't I tell you? Let's eat!

208
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,980
Hot!
