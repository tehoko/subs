1
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:12,063
Asuka Jr.

2
00:00:12,543 --> 00:00:13,908
Let's walk home together!

3
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:14,805
Sure!

4
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:17,147
We heard the news!

5
00:00:17,258 --> 00:00:19,351
You've been asked by the Mayor...

6
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:22,333
to help arrest that
phantom thief, Saint Tail!

7
00:00:23,813 --> 00:00:24,780
Is it true?

8
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,042
Yup, it sure is!

9
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:27,645
Wow! That's great!

10
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:30,021
They say you did great
on the last case!

11
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:34,428
How you protected the
jewels from Saint Tail!

12
00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:37,343
It was all over the papers!

13
00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:39,091
I read that article, too.

14
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:41,930
It said, "He protected the Blue
Meteorite from Saint Tail...

15
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:44,304
and helped in the arrest of Umido."
That's how it went?

16
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:45,472
Yup, that's how it went.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,585
But you let Saint Tail get away,
didn't you?

18
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:53,092
That's why I've been
asked to catch her.

19
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:57,445
I'm the only one who's
seen her up close.

20
00:00:59,196 --> 00:01:01,130
See! This is my official permit!

21
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:02,729
What is it?

22
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:06,136
It's the badge I gotfrom the Mayor.

23
00:01:07,122 --> 00:01:10,785
All I have to do is show this
and I can get in to investigate.

24
00:01:11,303 --> 00:01:12,930
Hey, that's really something.

25
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:16,270
Does your dad know?

26
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,683
He got himself all worked up over it.

27
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:21,891
He wants me to get the job done,
do or die.

28
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:26,937
Isn't that Saint Tail's first failure?

29
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:27,645
Failure?

30
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,625
And her nemesis is Asuka Jr.

31
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:33,525
I've got to hand it to you,
you're great!

32
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,804
It's true, it's true.

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,404
Ain't it fabulous?

34
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:38,680
Ah, it's nothing.

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,018
You've got it all wrong!

36
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:40,621
Huh?

37
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,098
I haven't failed!

38
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:45,971
Whose voice was that?

39
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:47,283
Beats me.

40
00:01:49,596 --> 00:01:52,793
Oh, Meimi,
don't let it bother you!

41
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:55,203
I've never failed once!

42
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:56,615
I know, I know.

43
00:01:56,686 --> 00:01:59,416
Why don't you drop by the
church for a while?

44
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:01,860
I haven't failed!

45
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:08,620
He's really asking for it!

46
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:11,588
As if a guy like that
could catch me!

47
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:14,498
My, you're fired up,
aren't you Meimi?

48
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:15,737
That's great!

49
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:16,440
Huh?

50
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,450
Your mission this time is...

51
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:24,501
This tiara.

52
00:02:25,514 --> 00:02:27,505
It's called Electra.

53
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:28,585
Electra?

54
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:34,933
Named for the star
in the Subaru constellation.

55
00:02:35,245 --> 00:02:37,042
Also known as "the missing one".

56
00:02:38,122 --> 00:02:42,582
It was stolen from someone by Egami,
who lives on 7th avenue.

57
00:02:43,606 --> 00:02:47,975
Let's return it to
its rightful owner.

58
00:02:48,523 --> 00:02:49,512
Wait a minute!

59
00:02:49,827 --> 00:02:50,452
What?

60
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:52,354
This wouldn't be a good time.

61
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:54,399
You heard, didn't you?

62
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:57,444
Asuka Jr. received a badge from the
Mayor, granting investigation power.

63
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,010
He's all wound up
and ready to leap into action.

64
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:05,560
Meimi, you're not afraid of
Asuka Jr., are you?

65
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:06,406
What?

66
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:10,116
If that's so, it can't be helped.

67
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:12,962
Let's forget about this caper.

68
00:03:13,037 --> 00:03:14,061
Wait a minute!

69
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,735
You're kidding, aren't you?

70
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:17,646
Let's do it!

71
00:03:17,886 --> 00:03:20,116
You just leave it to me!

72
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,298
I'm not afraid of a bumbling
detective like him at all!

73
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:30,454
I'm leaving!

74
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:37,037
Saint Tail... Isn't she wonderful?

75
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,745
She's exactly like me
when I was young.

76
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:41,556
Aww shoot...

77
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:43,723
That's strange.

78
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:48,773
What's the matter, Papa?

79
00:03:49,424 --> 00:03:51,483
The balloons...
where have I put them?

80
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,196
Balloons?

81
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,061
The ones I use for my magic.

82
00:03:57,015 --> 00:04:00,143
Aren't they supposed to
be in your trunk?

83
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,293
Yes, but they're not there!

84
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:09,617
Only the balloons have disappeared.

85
00:04:10,392 --> 00:04:12,656
Papa, are you sure they're missing?

86
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:16,000
Remember what happened
the other day.

87
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:18,705
You put two socks on one foot and...

88
00:04:19,054 --> 00:04:21,386
went around saying
"Where's my other sock?!"

89
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,391
Oh, don't bring that up.

90
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:27,443
Anyway, it's strange.

91
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:40,947
Hey! What's that?

92
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:42,458
Asuka! Up in the sky!

93
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:43,156
Huh?

94
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:47,872
What's that?

95
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:52,244
"I'll be picking up the Electra
tonight - Saint Tail."

96
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:55,967
It's a note from Saint Tail!

97
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,906
Hey, it's a challenge! What class!

98
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:01,423
You're kidding!

99
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:02,494
This is fantastic!

100
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:04,191
She's the phantom, alright!

101
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,028
She's got real guts!

102
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:13,016
I'll be ready for you, Saint Tail!

103
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:20,770
Meimi? Just what is this
all about exactly?

104
00:05:22,998 --> 00:05:27,833
Hey have you heard? Saint Tail
sent Asuka Jr. a challenge!

105
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:29,245
Don't you think that's strange?

106
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,343
What is?

107
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,753
Why do you think she told Asuka Jr.?

108
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:38,109
It does seem too good to be true.

109
00:05:38,348 --> 00:05:39,178
Doesn't it?

110
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:45,627
Maybe Saint Tail and Asuka Jr. are...

111
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:46,729
No doubt!

112
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:49,304
The two of them are in this together!

113
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,364
So...

114
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:00,208
Saint Tail has sent a challenge.

115
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:04,257
I won 't let anyone get
my tiara, Electra!

116
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:10,207
Sir, there is a rumor going around...

117
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:11,722
Yes, what is it?

118
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:17,260
What! Saint Tail and Asuka Jr.
are working together?!

119
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:18,834
Excuse me.

120
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:25,759
You're Mr. Egami, the tiara's owner,
aren't you?

121
00:06:26,206 --> 00:06:27,366
And you are?

122
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:32,142
The Mayor asked me to assist in
the Saint Tail investigation.

123
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,226
My name is Asuka.

124
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,933
Oh, so you're Asuka Jr.

125
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,142
I've been waiting for you.

126
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:46,195
Excuse me.

127
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:54,585
I leave all security in your hands.

128
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,093
Yes, sir! I understand.

129
00:06:56,606 --> 00:06:58,574
Please catch Saint Tail.

130
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:01,973
No matter what the rumors may say...

131
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,282
I trust you.

132
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:08,030
Rumors? What are you talking about?

133
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:09,704
You don't know?

134
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:13,678
There's great doubt
about you right now!

135
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:19,959
It's suspected that you
are Saint Tail's accomplice!

136
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:21,875
What did you say?

137
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,485
She sent you a note, didn't she?

138
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:27,334
Wait, please!

139
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,169
Of course.

140
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:32,336
I'm sure it's all just rumors.

141
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:38,890
For the sake of clearing your name,
please protect my Electra.

142
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:40,812
Of course!

143
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,217
Who'd want to work with
that girl, anyway?

144
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:44,728
Sir?

145
00:07:46,571 --> 00:07:49,062
Everything is ready.

146
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:51,980
The tiara is in place.

147
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:54,959
Everything has gone well.

148
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,731
The fool trusted me completely.

149
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:03,577
I'd never be tricked
by a brat like that!

150
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:08,332
I'll set them both up and turn him in
to the police along with Saint Tail!

151
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:12,174
By the way, Mr. Egami,
where is Electra right now?

152
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,789
The truth is, hearing about the
challenge made me nervous.

153
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,829
I couldn't leave it in the mansion,
so I've hidden it in a safe place.

154
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,516
You're really a worrier, aren't you?

155
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:26,526
So, where did you hide it?

156
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:29,542
Over there!

157
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,434
At the top of that clock tower.

158
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:45,256
Why hide it in such a difficult place?!

159
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:47,064
Where exactly in the
clock tower is it?

160
00:08:47,538 --> 00:08:49,199
On the face of the clock.

161
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:51,035
Behind the hour hand.

162
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:01,141
What!

163
00:09:01,316 --> 00:09:03,807
On the face of the clock,
behind the hour hand?

164
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:07,494
That's a tough place to get it from.

165
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:12,106
Actually, I know for sure he's lying.

166
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,521
The tiara is really behind
the minute hand.

167
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:17,919
How did you get information like that?

168
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,542
Egami is trying to frame Asuka Jr.!

169
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:24,650
What? A trap!

170
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:50,862
There's a rumor that Asuka Jr.
is Saint Tail's accomplice.

171
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:55,742
Egami would never tell him the true
hiding place of the tiara, would he?

172
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:04,674
He lied so Asuka Jr. will be
arrested along with Saint Tail.

173
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:06,526
That's terrible.

174
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:10,030
It's all because of that note you sent
to challenge him, Meimi!

175
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:12,038
You think so?

176
00:10:13,286 --> 00:10:17,017
I guess so... He's getting set up,
because of me!

177
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:26,844
If you steal the tiara from the minute
hand, Asuka Jr.'s name is cleared.

178
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,589
That's right.

179
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:32,835
My lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

180
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:38,798
One!

181
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:42,311
Two!

182
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:46,315
Three!

183
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:03,869
May the blessing of God be with us.

184
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:07,684
But I'll tell you this...

185
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,202
I'm not doing this to help him!

186
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,770
Yes, yes.

187
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,077
Off you go.

188
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:33,971
Asuka Jr.!

189
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,850
Do you intend to sit there and
stake out the place all night?

190
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:40,125
Not all night.

191
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:43,639
Saint Tail will be coming at exactly 6:00.

192
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:46,046
How do you know that?

193
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:50,522
The only time Saint Tail can reach
the hour hand is 6:00.

194
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,737
To steal Electra at any other time...

195
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,118
is impossible!

196
00:11:57,764 --> 00:11:58,662
I see.

197
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,562
I'm counting on you, Asuka Jr.

198
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:05,575
I'm waiting for you, Saint Tail!

199
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:13,267
What a fool! You don't know that
Electra is behind the minute hand!

200
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,349
At 6:00, everyone will see
that you and Saint Tail...

201
00:12:17,428 --> 00:12:18,918
are both idiots!

202
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:44,679
Looks like there isn't any security.

203
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,389
I have to climb the clock tower.

204
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:04,974
That's...!

205
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:17,179
Almost 6:00. Time for Saint Tail
to make her appearance.

206
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,493
Sir! We've got trouble!

207
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,095
What's wrong?
Why are you so excited?

208
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:28,046
Sir! Someone is climbing the ladder
on the side of the clock tower!

209
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:29,023
What?

210
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:32,060
That ladder leads to the top stairs!

211
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:33,234
Oh, no!

212
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:59,151
Okay! Saint Tail, come on out!

213
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:00,497
Hi!

214
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:02,363
What?

215
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:07,041
What a beautiful moon.
I'm so happy you waited for me.

216
00:14:07,624 --> 00:14:09,023
Saint Tail.

217
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,255
Why are you up there?

218
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:13,065
I know where it's really hidden.

219
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,601
Electra is behind the minute hand.

220
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:20,090
Behind the minute hand?

221
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:32,890
Well, that's it. I've got Electra.

222
00:14:37,422 --> 00:14:39,515
My Electra is being stolen!

223
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,860
Wait! Saint Tail!

224
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:43,197
Darn!

225
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:46,208
What's going on?!

226
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,152
Mr. Egami, you said the Electra was
behind the hour hand!

227
00:14:49,229 --> 00:14:50,196
Shut up!

228
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:53,402
Saint Tail, I won't let you get away!

229
00:14:58,894 --> 00:15:00,521
You can't escape!

230
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,767
Don't move, Saint Tail!

231
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:09,253
It's showtime!

232
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:26,676
That's the balloon she used
to send me the challenge.

233
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:29,182
Bye, bye!

234
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,189
Darn it!

235
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:33,461
You won't get away!

236
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:51,425
Ouch!

237
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,314
This time,
I'll bust that big one!

238
00:16:00,563 --> 00:16:02,861
Stop!

239
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:04,262
Shut up!!

240
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:22,789
This will get my Electra back!

241
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,687
Brat! How dare you!

242
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:46,442
Cut it out!! ...Stop!!

243
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:52,226
Stop... please...

244
00:16:59,357 --> 00:17:02,849
I wasn't trying to protect you!
Don't misunderstand what I did!

245
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:08,313
Listen!

246
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,217
Keep sending me those challenges!

247
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:11,949
Give me a fair chance!

248
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,334
I'll get you sooner or later!

249
00:17:14,573 --> 00:17:16,541
Are you listening?!

250
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,699
I don't know why,
but it's fun to have him around.

251
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,708
And I'll do anything
to keep on feeling this way.

252
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:38,581
Good Morning!

253
00:17:38,854 --> 00:17:39,786
Good Morning!

254
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:52,116
The real owner was very happy.

255
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,628
She says, "Thank you for
returning Electra".

256
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,970
Hang on a sec.
I'll catch up with you.

257
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,809
Sure.

258
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:04,963
That old man...
he even had me fooled!

259
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:07,172
Hey, great detective!

260
00:18:07,748 --> 00:18:09,716
You're a hero in the papers, again.

261
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,516
You caught another crook, huh?

262
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:14,825
Yeah... but Saint Tail still got away.

263
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,871
Well, you can give us the details later.

264
00:18:20,022 --> 00:18:21,250
Asuka Jr.!

265
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:23,491
Asuka Jr.!

266
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,665
What do you want?

267
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:29,245
Glad to hear your name's been cleared.
That's great!

268
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,053
Yeah. Thanks.

269
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:37,096
And you let Saint Tail get away again.
I hear you're on bad terms with her.

270
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:40,146
What do you mean, "again"!

271
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:43,121
Anyway, it's none of your business!

272
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:47,733
Ah, she's a hopeless case.

273
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:51,654
But that cut...! Could it be?

274
00:18:58,883 --> 00:19:01,010
Well, hang in there till next time!

275
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:07,629
I know that Saint Tail is a girl
about the same age as me.

276
00:19:09,217 --> 00:19:10,377
It couldn't be...

277
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:13,057
Nah, it can't be!

278
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:32,813
Saint Tail Mini-Theatre!
"The Great Hot Potato Chase!"

279
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:45,423
Autumn leaves.
It'll be fall in no time.

280
00:19:46,941 --> 00:19:47,965
Meimi?

281
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:50,680
I'm at the best part of the story,
so don't talk to me right now!

282
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:53,355
Autumn, is a season for reading...

283
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:56,658
But how about reading something
other than comic books sometime?

284
00:19:57,878 --> 00:20:00,506
Ah... "Autumn of Romance."

285
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,380
I'd like to be chased by...

286
00:20:03,462 --> 00:20:07,125
a handsome, passionate lover,
like the girl in this comic!

287
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:15,247
But Meimi, you do have a passionate
person chasing after you, don't you?

288
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:22,236
Hot potatoes!

289
00:20:27,307 --> 00:20:29,639
Meimi! How un-ladylike!

290
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:33,482
My, Seira.
Wasn't that your stomach just now?

291
00:20:33,594 --> 00:20:42,127
That's right ladies! Come and get them!
They're hot and sweet!

292
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,696
Autumn's the season to
crave sweet potatoes!

293
00:20:47,373 --> 00:20:50,672
Stone-baked sweet potatoes!
Hot!

294
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:53,151
Well then Meimi, please go ahead!

295
00:20:53,494 --> 00:20:59,330
Hey, just a minute!
Why should I have to go buy it myself!

296
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:05,051
I'm a servant of God. Sister told me
it's forbidden for me to buy and eat.

297
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,632
Oh really? Then that means I don't
have to get one for you, right?

298
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:16,852
Buying is forbidden, but it's fine
to have a kind friend share a snack.

299
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,845
I always have to play these roles.

300
00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:23,210
Someday, Seira's gonna get punished!

301
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:27,561
Natural and delicious!
Stone-baked hot potatoes!

302
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,699
Nobody's looking... here I go!

303
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:31,304
Sir!

304
00:21:31,385 --> 00:21:33,353
Hey! Haneoka, is that you?

305
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,024
That voice!

306
00:21:37,605 --> 00:21:39,300
Asuka Jr.!

307
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:41,747
What are you doing here?

308
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:44,821
Wha... what?
It's none of your business!

309
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:47,729
What about you!
What are you doing here?

310
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,168
What else?

311
00:21:49,445 --> 00:21:52,380
I'm in the middle of an investigation
to catch Saint Tail's tail!

312
00:21:52,588 --> 00:21:53,520
Don't even try.

313
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,321
Saint Tail isn't a slowpoke
that you'd be able to catch!

314
00:21:56,836 --> 00:21:57,928
What did you say?!

315
00:21:58,006 --> 00:22:01,874
The Mayor himself commissioned me!

316
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,250
So don't interfere!

317
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:06,294
Are you kidding?

318
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,799
This isn't a Samurai movie!

319
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:10,465
Who'd be impressed with
a thing like that?

320
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:12,139
-What did you say?!
-What of it?!

321
00:22:12,253 --> 00:22:15,654
Stone-baked hot potatoes!

322
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,663
Piping hot sweet potatoes!

323
00:22:18,808 --> 00:22:21,971
Wait! Mr. hot potato vendor!

324
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,180
What's with you?

325
00:22:25,597 --> 00:22:28,998
Why are you acting so strange?
Did you want to buy a sweet potato?

326
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,277
That's right! Anything wrong with that?!
Go ahead and laugh!

327
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,717
How stupid.

328
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,758
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

329
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,058
I like them, too.
Sweet potatoes.

330
00:22:39,342 --> 00:22:40,400
Get on!

331
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:43,672
Let's go!
We can still catch it!

332
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:54,752
All right!
There it is!

333
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:09,662
It's a patrol car!
What are we gonna do?

334
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:12,505
We can't stop!
What am I supposed to do!

335
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:15,719
You two on the bicycle up ahead!
Stop right now!

336
00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:19,298
Oh, no!
It's my dad's patrol car!

337
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:23,506
Blah Blah Blah Blah...

338
00:23:24,758 --> 00:23:26,282
I'm sorry Asuka Jr.

339
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:28,024
It's all because of me.

340
00:23:28,136 --> 00:23:29,569
Don't worry.

341
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,609
I'm used to Dad chewing me out.

342
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:35,844
More importantly, I'm sorry we
didn't get to buy the sweet potato.

343
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:38,599
Oh yeah! I forgot all about it!

344
00:23:38,938 --> 00:23:40,371
What do you mean you forgot?

345
00:23:41,982 --> 00:23:45,281
Piping hot sweet potatoes!

346
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:48,761
Wait!

347
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:50,973
Sweet potato vendor!

348
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:01,536
Meimi sure is taking a long time!
