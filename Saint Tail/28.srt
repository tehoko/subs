1
00:00:17,287 --> 00:00:22,281
Excuse me, aren't you Emi Honma,
the teenage idol?

2
00:00:23,134 --> 00:00:25,466
Yes. Have we met somewhere?

3
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:29,335
-I see your picture in the magazines.
-I'm flattered.

4
00:00:29,582 --> 00:00:32,745
What brings you here today?

5
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:38,223
You don't have to say if it puts
someone in a difficult situation.

6
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,797
No, I want to tell you.
The truth is, I have a problem.

7
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:47,642
I've been dating someone, but no one,
not even my management agency, knows.

8
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:50,291
I put a picture
taken of us together...

9
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:53,830
...in my locket
and always kept it near me.

10
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:57,507
Once, when I left it in
my dressing room for a moment...

11
00:00:57,747 --> 00:01:02,081
...Mr. Iwasaki from a rival
production came and stole it.

12
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:03,584
Oh, dear.

13
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:08,821
And then Mr. Iwasaki came
to me and said:

14
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:14,777
Let me see, what should I do
about this, this picture?

15
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:19,317
The press would go crazy
if I sold it to them.

16
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:22,259
But that would mean
the end of your career.

17
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:26,736
-Please, give it back to me!
-OK, I'll give it back to you.

18
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:30,178
In exchange, your part
as Yoko in that new movie...

19
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:34,380
...you could turn down the part
and give it to one of my girls.

20
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,063
You could pretend to be sick
or something.

21
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:43,108
If you don't do it, I won't be
responsible for this picture.

22
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:46,015
How terrible!

23
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:48,726
I don't want to cause trouble
for my agency.

24
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:51,899
I came here because
I don't know what to do.

25
00:01:52,138 --> 00:01:56,837
Please cheer up.
I'm sure God will help you.

26
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,817
SAVE THE PRETTY IDOL GIRL!

27
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:07,832
Meimi!

28
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:11,575
Big news, big news!

29
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:12,841
Sawatari.

30
00:02:13,922 --> 00:02:16,584
The shampoo company's
image girl contest!

31
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:19,821
Look, you passed
the preliminaries! See?

32
00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:24,270
Wow! That's great!

33
00:02:26,484 --> 00:02:30,750
Yep, you're one step closer
to becoming a big star.

34
00:02:30,994 --> 00:02:34,657
-This is great!
-You'll go to the contest, won't you?

35
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:36,393
Just hold on there!

36
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,599
And when you become a big star,
don't forget about us!

37
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,976
Listen...

38
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,419
No way! She'll be so busy, she won't
even be able to come to school!

39
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,930
-Oh, wow!
-Sawatari!

40
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:55,503
If you think becoming a big star
is that easy, you're crazy!

41
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:03,619
-What's with him? Spoilsport.
-Really.

42
00:03:04,204 --> 00:03:07,071
I wonder, was it something we said?

43
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:10,576
I don't think so, no.

44
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:14,285
Oh, I almost forgot.
Rina also passed. See?

45
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,791
No!

46
00:03:19,305 --> 00:03:21,739
I'm pretty sure she entered herself.

47
00:03:21,978 --> 00:03:24,310
She has a lot
of confidence in herself.

48
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:33,431
I'm not going to participate
in the contest! No way!

49
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:38,404
Now, Meimi, listen. That girl Emi
who came here yesterday for help...

50
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,346
The one who wants her locket?
I'll do it!

51
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,994
You don't understand. Emi is one
of the judges for that contest.

52
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:49,796
She was one of the past winners.

53
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,611
And that Mr. Iwasaki is
also one of the judges.

54
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:57,879
Unless Emi announces she is turning
down the role by that day...

55
00:03:58,127 --> 00:04:01,824
...he says he'll publicize the picture
after the contest.

56
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,801
I think our best bet would be
to get the locket...

57
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,208
...during the contest
and return it to Emi.

58
00:04:09,654 --> 00:04:12,680
But why do I have to enter a contest?

59
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:16,631
I understand.

60
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,239
I would never have guessed that
you were so afraid of contests.

61
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:26,350
-Just hold on there!
-Forget it. Just forget it.

62
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:32,225
Who says I'm afraid? All right then,
I'll show you. I'll enter that contest!

63
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,307
Forgive me, Meimi.

64
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:46,198
I didn't mean to say what I did.

65
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,248
A note!

66
00:04:56,695 --> 00:05:00,131
"On the day of the beauty contest,
I'll take a locket...

67
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:05,240
...from Mr. Iwasaki of the Rainbow
Production Company. -St. Tail"

68
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,411
Hey, come back here!

69
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:21,672
Rina. Give it to me.

70
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,787
Did you hear?
I'm entering that contest too.

71
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:27,188
I want to test my capabilities.

72
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,966
The one Sawatari was talking about,
you're in it too?

73
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,142
Will you come and watch me?

74
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:37,171
Why do I have to go?
Girls are a pain.

75
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:40,391
Oh, all right. Now give it back!

76
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:45,623
That's all you think about, St. Tail!
It was a man dressed like a girl!

77
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:52,550
There's a future star
standing right in front of you!

78
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,554
Give it back!

79
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:04,576
Asuka Jr., have you, you know,
gotten taller?

80
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:10,689
I'd better make my move. Soon the
other girls will start noticing him.

81
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:16,864
I'd better stake my claim on him.

82
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:25,793
I'm home!

83
00:06:26,201 --> 00:06:28,635
- Hi there!
- Hi, Meimi.

84
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:33,277
-Emi Honma's being interviewed on TV.
-Really?

85
00:06:33,718 --> 00:06:36,687
Emi, congratulations
on getting the role of Yoko.

86
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:41,589
Thank you.
I owe everything to all my fans.

87
00:06:41,837 --> 00:06:46,740
And does that include your boyfriend?

88
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:50,748
My boyfriend is all of my fans.

89
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:53,720
Poor Emi, it must be hard for her.

90
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:57,932
She's right. She's too young
to have a boyfriend.

91
00:06:58,174 --> 00:06:59,903
I wouldn't be so sure.

92
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:04,445
Even junior high kids have
significant others these days.

93
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:10,059
Meimi, you don't have a boyfriend,
do you? You're much too young.

94
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,035
I never imagined!
My Meimi's got a boyfriend!

95
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:17,249
I what?

96
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:20,352
Oh, dear, my idyllic life
is coming to an end.

97
00:07:20,592 --> 00:07:25,586
Calm down, dear. Meimi hasn't said
anything about liking a certain boy!

98
00:07:25,838 --> 00:07:28,238
What? You don't like boys?

99
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:31,605
Does that mean you prefer girls?
That is a problem.

100
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,945
Let's have a heart-to-heart talk.

101
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:36,386
I'm going to my room.

102
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:39,063
-Enough of this nonsense!
-But, Eimi...

103
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:49,483
I'm home, Ruby. Did you miss me?

104
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,621
You're my best friend, aren't you?

105
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,979
Sorry. I had something on my mind.

106
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:09,463
If I become a star,
I wonder if he'll look at me.

107
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,585
We've been waiting for you.

108
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:23,060
My name is Yamashiro.
I'm in charge of this contest.

109
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,170
This is Mr. Iwasaki
from Rainbow Productions.

110
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,377
Hello.

111
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:31,413
You'd better arrest that burglar.
She's such a nuisance!

112
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:33,414
I'm doing my best!

113
00:08:34,863 --> 00:08:38,890
Your father may be a detective,
but how will you arrest her?

114
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:43,974
Judging from this building's floor
plan and her mode of operation...

115
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:48,813
...there's a high possibility
she'll appear directly on-stage.

116
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:53,158
And so I thought we could rig
the stage curtain...

117
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:57,307
...to fall on her like a casting net,
thus trapping her.

118
00:08:57,815 --> 00:09:00,306
I understand. You have my permission.

119
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:04,515
I will capture her.
I won't fail this time.

120
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:19,761
And now the contest begins.

121
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,829
First is a question-and-answer
segment, then a camera test.

122
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:26,704
Entry 1, please come forward!

123
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:30,485
Entry 1, Manami Yoshizawa.
I'm 16 years old.

124
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:33,193
What are you currently most devoted to?

125
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,261
To my music and dancing.

126
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:39,529
I am also serious about putting
every effort into this audition.

127
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:40,746
Thank you.

128
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:44,439
-What are your dreams for the future?
-To become an actress.

129
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:47,458
-Please turn to the right.
-Of course.

130
00:09:47,697 --> 00:09:51,428
All right. Now turn around and smile.

131
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:55,609
Make a complete turn.
That's fine, thank you.

132
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:59,875
-This isn't easy, is it?
-Next contestant, entry 2.

133
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:03,991
My name is Mutsumi Hijiri.

134
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:07,369
My name is Yoko Hizawa.

135
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,101
My name is Yuki Uchida.

136
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:14,375
Seira, where's Rina and Meimi?

137
00:10:14,926 --> 00:10:18,089
-I'm sure they'll be out soon.
-I guess.

138
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:21,929
My name is Rina Takamiya.
I'm 14 years old.

139
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:24,576
I'm pleased to meet you all.

140
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:28,074
15, is there someone special
in your life now?

141
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:31,586
Yes, there is.

142
00:10:37,812 --> 00:10:41,578
All right, smile.
Now turn to the right.

143
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:47,384
Darn that St. Tail. Why does she
want the locket Mr. Iwasaki has?

144
00:10:47,635 --> 00:10:49,626
I don't understand.

145
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:55,171
Never mind. I've got to concentrate
on capturing her, that's all.

146
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:57,444
All right, come on, St. Tail.

147
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,057
Look, it's Meimi!

148
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,234
Number 18.
My name is Meimi Haneoka.

149
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:06,498
How old are you?

150
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:09,873
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm 14.

151
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,381
What is your idea of the perfect man?

152
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:15,390
This I've got to hear!

153
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:28,614
Someone like my father!

154
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,386
Rats.

155
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:34,194
Oops, I think I goofed.

156
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:41,450
And that concludes
our program for today.

157
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:46,026
The results of today's judging
of these 50 contestants...

158
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:48,794
...will be sent out within 3 days.

159
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,273
There's still one left, 51!

160
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:54,284
What's going on?

161
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,285
This part of the show?

162
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:00,265
What's going on here?

163
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:04,995
-Is there someone left?
-No, I'm sure there were only 50 girls.

164
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:08,043
Turn on the lights!
Where are the lights?

165
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:16,122
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

166
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:18,599
On the screen...

167
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:21,103
St. Tail?

168
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,589
One!

169
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:31,233
Two!

170
00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:35,677
Three!

171
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,615
It's St. Tail!

172
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:00,631
Hi!

173
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:07,080
What is this smoke?

174
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:09,586
Is it St. Tail?

175
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:12,990
Meimi, I pray God is with you.

176
00:13:13,236 --> 00:13:16,069
Now, drop the curtain!

177
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:19,510
Seira!

178
00:13:20,318 --> 00:13:24,482
We'd better not move around now.
Besides, you seem pretty slow.

179
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:25,991
Sorry.

180
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:29,463
Don't worry, you'll be safe with me.

181
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:40,958
What's so funny?
I haven't told any jokes.

182
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:44,903
Drop the curtain! Hurry!
What's the holdup?

183
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,346
Sorry, Asuka Jr.! We can't move!

184
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:52,347
Number 51, St. Tail!

185
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:55,322
I am a thief! How's that?

186
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:58,831
Damn! You're not getting the locket!

187
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:03,303
I see you, Mr. Iwasaki!
You won't get away!

188
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,859
It's...

189
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:12,326
...Show...

190
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,806
...Time!

191
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:29,204
Beauty contests are fun
but how's this shampoo?

192
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:33,077
Now, watch closely.

193
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,523
One!

194
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:40,062
Two!

195
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:42,566
Three!

196
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:55,058
St. Tail, that's not fair!

197
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,293
My locket.

198
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,468
I have the locket!

199
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:17,445
Thank you.

200
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:19,450
Damn this smoke!

201
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:22,923
I'm definitely going
to get that St. Tail!

202
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:31,608
You should be ashamed.
As the mayor's niece, I'm embarrassed.

203
00:15:31,854 --> 00:15:33,378
We're sorry!

204
00:15:34,426 --> 00:15:37,827
Rats. You're not
getting away with this.

205
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:40,866
I don't care who does it,
just pull the rope!

206
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:43,138
Rope?

207
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:56,768
-Asuka Jr.!
-Meimi!

208
00:15:57,011 --> 00:15:58,638
Oh, no!

209
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:01,848
It's so heavy.

210
00:16:02,323 --> 00:16:04,848
Hurry. I've got to get out of here.

211
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,363
This isn't exactly going as I planned.

212
00:16:11,545 --> 00:16:16,346
- This can't be happening!
-I've got you at last!

213
00:16:18,762 --> 00:16:21,128
He'll hate me!

214
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:25,373
Let me see your face!

215
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,273
Please don't hate me.

216
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:31,286
No!

217
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:36,225
Asuka Jr.! Sorry! Are you all right?

218
00:16:40,378 --> 00:16:44,712
Don't arrest her!
She got my locket back for me!

219
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:03,862
Asuka Jr.?

220
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:13,616
She got my locket back for me!

221
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,377
It's a sure bet that I didn't pass.

222
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:31,851
You can never tell! Sometimes
they go for things like that.

223
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:34,761
-Seira.
-Yes?

224
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:37,801
I can't wait for the results!

225
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:42,310
Don't worry about it.
You had the best response!

226
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:49,289
I goofed up.

227
00:17:58,123 --> 00:18:00,921
Give it up, trying to be a star.

228
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:02,431
What?

229
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:06,433
Your father wouldn't approve.

230
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:11,479
If I were your father, I wouldn't.

231
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:19,432
Yes, you're right.

232
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:30,289
What a disappointment!
Both Meimi and Rina didn't pass.

233
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:35,764
We thought they'd be able to
introduce us to some handsome actors!

234
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,717
Listen here...

235
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:54,440
I'm positive
he had her trapped back then.

236
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:56,654
But he let her go.

237
00:19:01,568 --> 00:19:03,866
I'm positive of that!

238
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:11,840
I've got a great idea.
I'll keep St. Tail away from him.

239
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:16,894
That way, he's sure to notice me!
