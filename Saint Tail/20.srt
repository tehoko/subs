1
00:00:05,418 --> 00:00:08,148
-Good morning, Meimi.
-Good morning, Seira.

2
00:00:08,757 --> 00:00:12,158
-Another lovely day, isn't it?
-It sure is.

3
00:00:17,174 --> 00:00:19,802
Seira, what's going on there?

4
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:24,814
Maybe Asuka Jr.'s solved a case
and they want his autograph.

5
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:27,115
That's ridiculous!

6
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:34,503
Yutaka, please!
Get your father to sign this.

7
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:38,470
But my father's not even an actor.

8
00:00:39,316 --> 00:00:41,784
What's going on here?

9
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:47,858
Didn't you know?
Yutaka's father wrote a bestseller.

10
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:51,591
Oh, really? Seira, did you know?

11
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:55,800
I bought one. It's titled
Expedition Journal of Jurassic Island.

12
00:00:56,416 --> 00:01:01,012
His father discovered an egg
of the legendary bird.

13
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:03,788
A legendary bird?

14
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:09,764
GET BACK THE PHANTOM BIRD EGG!

15
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:18,718
-Seira, have you read it?
-Yes, would you like to read it?

16
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:24,790
It looks so hard.
Maybe I'll just go get his autograph.

17
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:31,172
Professor Mochizuki, Yutaka's father,
is a well-known explorer.

18
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:34,883
He was investigating
the existence of the bird...

19
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:38,115
...in a jungle
in the southern hemisphere.

20
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:41,130
And he discovered the egg?

21
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:46,797
Yes. A fiery red Apua bird said
to have lived on the island ages ago.

22
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:50,072
Then he compiled his report
into a book.

23
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:56,517
Exploring a jungle,
a fiery red bird. How romantic!

24
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,642
A lizard!

25
00:02:07,217 --> 00:02:12,382
You'll never go exploring the jungle
if this little thing scares you.

26
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:27,148
Mr. Asuka, pets are not allowed
in the school.

27
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:31,759
As punishment, you will clean
the birdcage after school!

28
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:35,362
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,328
Your father's precious egg?

30
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:53,897
Yes, a Professor Hyuga from
the Scientific Research lnstitute...

31
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:57,634
...came by, claiming
to be my father's friend.

32
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:04,789
I'd appreciate you letting me
borrow your father's egg.

33
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:09,588
My father's not in tonight.
Can you wait until tomorrow?

34
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:12,639
I have his permission.

35
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:15,471
I'd like to study the egg...

36
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:19,379
...as part of my research
of the Apua bird.

37
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,026
Why, I promise to return it
in two or three days.

38
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,031
He said he'd return it and I let him
take it without thinking it through.

39
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:32,008
What? Hyuga took the egg last night?

40
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,344
Oh, God, I'm finished.

41
00:03:35,553 --> 00:03:38,283
Dad, what do you mean?

42
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:43,596
Yutaka, I made the egg. It's a fake.

43
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:46,930
I painted an ostrich egg.

44
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:51,377
Then you lied
about discovering the egg?

45
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:54,644
You wrote that book
based on pure fiction?

46
00:03:54,957 --> 00:03:58,188
No, I'm certain
I really did find the egg.

47
00:03:58,397 --> 00:04:01,491
Animals are very delicate creatures.

48
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:05,803
Being tossed around on
a long ocean voyage to Japan...

49
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:07,808
...would kill any animal.

50
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:11,815
That egg is priceless,
so I didn't bring it back.

51
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:15,981
-I wanted the bird to be raised there.
-I see.

52
00:04:16,364 --> 00:04:21,666
But I had to let the world
know of my discovery.

53
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:26,834
I needed proof
to convince my colleagues.

54
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,089
So you made the fake to use as proof.

55
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:37,289
But I never imagined my book
would cause such a sensation.

56
00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:42,943
A man in my position should never have
used a fake to prove his discovery.

57
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,312
Then why don't you explain it
to everyone now?

58
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:49,755
You're right.
But of all the bad luck...

59
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:53,659
...it will be Hyuga
who breaks the news.

60
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:57,699
I see.

61
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:03,040
Professor Hyuga has always
criticized my father's research.

62
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:07,953
If he analyzes the egg,
he's sure to realize it's a fake.

63
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:10,598
I need the egg back before that.

64
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:13,532
And where is the egg now?

65
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:16,369
Hyuga's Scientific Research lnstitute.

66
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,880
A fake egg, huh?

67
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:26,388
Using a fake to prove one's theory
is certainly unforgivable.

68
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:31,002
But Professor Mochizuki
deeply regrets it now.

69
00:05:31,575 --> 00:05:36,012
And it's too bad Professor Hyuga
will reveal the truth.

70
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:39,812
I did some checking and learned
that Professor Hyuga...

71
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:44,017
...is scheduled to go on TV
tomorrow to discuss the egg.

72
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:45,831
I understand.

73
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:50,028
You want me to get the egg
before he analyzes it.

74
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:53,407
Brilliant deduction.
I knew I could count on you.

75
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:02,995
Why did she have to stick me
with this dirty job?

76
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,170
I need to clean this place up.

77
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,448
What's this?

78
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:19,285
What? "Tonight at 8:00, I am going
to Professor Hyuga's lab...

79
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,530
...to steal the legendary egg.
-St. Tail." St. Tail's note!

80
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:33,579
-I'm home!
-Welcome home, Meimi.

81
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:36,388
What's with Dad?

82
00:06:41,742 --> 00:06:44,074
Hi, Dad!

83
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:46,481
Oh, Meimi, welcome home.

84
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:52,352
What's the matter? You promised
to show me your trick when I got back.

85
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:55,760
I'm sorry. I got so involved
with the program.

86
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:57,300
What program?

87
00:06:57,506 --> 00:06:59,736
UNCOVER PARANORMAL PHENOMENA
WlTH DR. HYUGA

88
00:06:59,944 --> 00:07:02,777
-You know him?
-Yeah, in a way.

89
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:08,512
You were saying there is nothing
that is scientifically unexplainable.

90
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:10,354
That's right.

91
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:16,560
Supernatural phenomena and legendary
creatures do not exist in our society.

92
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:20,473
For example, mirages
and a dead person's spirit...

93
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:26,452
...which so many romanticize about,
have been scientifically explained.

94
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,058
This is a mirage, right?

95
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:35,297
Isn't it incredible? Even a machine
is capable of creating one.

96
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:37,274
And now, to continue...

97
00:07:37,482 --> 00:07:39,950
A dead person's spirit!

98
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:46,789
Lately, I've been hearing of fools
causing a sensation by ranting...

99
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:51,131
...of miracles and legends,
but I will expose them all!

100
00:07:51,342 --> 00:07:54,311
This journal is a bestseller, right?

101
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:59,452
Yes. In my professional opinion,
the legendary Apua bird...

102
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:03,957
...does not exist anywhere.
This book is a fake.

103
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:09,729
And tomorrow on this program,
we will reveal the infamous egg!

104
00:08:11,013 --> 00:08:14,676
The egg Professor Mochizuki found
cannot be real!

105
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:17,378
And I will expose--

106
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:18,784
Mom!

107
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:21,463
Why'd you turn it off?
It was interesting.

108
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,459
Because I don't like that man!

109
00:08:25,674 --> 00:08:28,871
The other day at a magic show,
that awful man...

110
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:32,312
...revealed the secrets
in front of the magician!

111
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,546
Then he's one of Dad's enemies.

112
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:39,888
That's right. Without the world's
mysteries and magic...

113
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,502
...there'd be no dreams or hope!

114
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:47,735
You're right. Eimi, I appreciate
you always thinking of me.

115
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,111
Oh, dear, I...

116
00:08:54,195 --> 00:08:56,686
Oh, brother, here we go again!

117
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,200
Hi, Ruby!

118
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,610
I've got work to do. I'll play
with you in just a little while.

119
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:27,251
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

120
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:34,031
One!

121
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,541
Two!

122
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:42,141
Three!

123
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,976
Meimi, you have to be
extra careful this time.

124
00:09:58,352 --> 00:09:59,910
Don't worry!

125
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:04,751
I've heard Professor Hyuga has
a state-of-the-art security system...

126
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:07,194
...wired in his laboratory.

127
00:10:07,402 --> 00:10:10,997
It just makes the job
more challenging for me!

128
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:16,647
May the blessings of God be with us.

129
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,667
HYUGA SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH INSTITUTE

130
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:29,272
I appreciate you reporters
coming out here.

131
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:34,211
Professor Hyuga, there are reports
St. Tail has announced--

132
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:37,219
I don't know about any St. Tail...

133
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:43,422
...but my computers will capture
any brash, petty thief!

134
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:46,573
Well, just wait and see!

135
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:00,928
You seem to be
my personal bodyguards...

136
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:04,198
...but I told you,
I don't need your protection.

137
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:07,312
You're not taking St. Tail
very seriously!

138
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:10,111
If she says she's coming, she will!

139
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,257
Detective, I appreciate your concern,
but I want you to leave.

140
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:17,592
I have enough help here.

141
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,335
We can't do that.

142
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,534
Since she has made her announcement,
it is our duty to arrest her.

143
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:30,711
This laboratory has been equipped with
the latest computers I've invented.

144
00:11:30,928 --> 00:11:34,227
When it comes to police intuition
or experience...

145
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:36,904
...I just don't believe in that.

146
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:42,044
That is your prerogative, but
our job is to stand guard right here.

147
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,911
Have it your way then.

148
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:47,322
That door is unlocked, isn't it?

149
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:51,895
St. Tail can easily enter from here.

150
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:57,437
As part of my plan, I'm letting
St. Tail get in easily!

151
00:11:57,646 --> 00:12:03,585
I will capture her alive and then
my secret weapon will go into action!

152
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:05,489
Secret weapon?

153
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:09,624
And this is it!

154
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:11,168
I AM A GENIUS!

155
00:12:14,512 --> 00:12:15,672
Perfect.

156
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:19,547
What is that?

157
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,948
These will not kill or hurt anything.

158
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:28,395
It's like a tranquilizer gun
for live capture.

159
00:12:28,906 --> 00:12:31,898
That's quite impressive.
And what is this?

160
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:35,377
Oh, that.
That's the character analyzer.

161
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:38,016
It looks like it'll fry someone.

162
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:43,388
Shall I demonstrate it?
You just stand there quietly.

163
00:12:56,826 --> 00:13:00,489
Daisuke Asuka. Born August 22.

164
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,430
Horoscope: Leo. Blood type: AB.

165
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:09,005
Fantastic! It analyzes one's personal
data just by shining a light.

166
00:13:09,216 --> 00:13:12,481
Does that mean
if the light hits St. Tail...

167
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:15,157
...we'll learn her true identity?

168
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:19,990
That's right. Today's the day
we learn her true identity.

169
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:22,638
Aren't you happy?

170
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:27,780
Just in case, I'm going
to tape St. Tail's capture...

171
00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:30,852
...and have it shown on national TV.

172
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:33,087
What a showoff!

173
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:36,992
If I am unable to capture her...

174
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:41,071
...I will shave my head completely!

175
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:52,530
It's almost time.

176
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:03,709
What's that? It's St. Tail!

177
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:10,156
We've got you, St. Tail!
Assistants A, B, fire!

178
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:14,702
Here I am! Here!

179
00:14:19,183 --> 00:14:21,174
Drat! Give it to me!

180
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:26,692
-She'll never be able to get close!
-Not here, at any rate!

181
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:32,296
You idiot! What are you shooting at?

182
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,772
You call this gun safe?

183
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:39,883
It's...

184
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:43,652
...show...

185
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:48,233
...time!

186
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:55,311
What are these things? Stop!

187
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:58,287
Here goes!

188
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:03,723
Now's my chance!

189
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,234
You're not getting away!

190
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,943
Damn! I'll reveal her identity!

191
00:15:14,923 --> 00:15:16,413
Look out!

192
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,031
I won't let you get away!

193
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:27,169
Take that!

194
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:34,620
Here!

195
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:49,352
Stop, St. Tail!

196
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:51,183
I'll let you go today...

197
00:15:51,393 --> 00:15:55,727
...only because I don't want
to capture you with machinery!

198
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:58,403
Thank you.

199
00:16:03,516 --> 00:16:07,509
-Professor! Professor!
-The egg, the egg.

200
00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:10,487
Professor, snap out of it!

201
00:16:10,697 --> 00:16:14,064
What was I doing? That's right!

202
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:19,503
I'm sure my computer grasped
St. Tail's true identity!

203
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:21,545
Are you sure?

204
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:24,481
St. Tail's identity.

205
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:28,254
Everything's in order!

206
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:32,268
What happened?

207
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:35,439
It's all white.

208
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:40,041
Hey, what's the meaning of this?

209
00:16:43,025 --> 00:16:46,085
This is one of those pebbles
St. Tail threw.

210
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,824
-What is it, Dad?
-Impossible!

211
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:53,869
Hey! Dad, isn't this a magnet?

212
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,480
I get it. These machines
don't take to magnets.

213
00:16:57,787 --> 00:17:03,692
That's ridiculous!
But the video should show her face.

214
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:14,042
My machines of the latest technology
were thwarted by mere magnets. Damn!

215
00:17:18,693 --> 00:17:20,320
What's that?

216
00:17:26,141 --> 00:17:30,703
What's this?
Dad, it's the egg! The egg's back!

217
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,680
What did you say?

218
00:17:34,523 --> 00:17:36,286
This.

219
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:41,129
Yutaka, I'm going to make
a public apology.

220
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,928
About the egg being a fake?

221
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:50,005
Yes, and I'll ask everyone to help
preserve the island's natural state.

222
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,120
Dad.

223
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:56,754
I'm so glad.

224
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,435
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

225
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:05,969
Professor Mochizuki was so very happy.

226
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:12,815
-Good morning, Meimi, Seira.
-We'd better hurry!

227
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:16,127
-Please let us through!
-Again?

228
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:19,569
Congratulations! I saw the paper.

229
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:24,612
The Apua bird's egg on
Jurassic lsland hatched, didn't it?

230
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,082
It's so neat! Please get me
your father's autograph.

231
00:18:29,462 --> 00:18:31,089
Well, I...

232
00:18:34,638 --> 00:18:36,105
DR. HYUGA WENT BALD!

233
00:18:40,282 --> 00:18:42,045
Good morning, Asuka Jr.

234
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:45,689
Did you see this?
Look at that bald fool!

235
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:51,695
A bet's a bet. And he bet he could
reveal St. Tail's true identity.

236
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:57,232
I guess that means capturing St. Tail
should be left to you, Asuka Jr.

237
00:18:57,448 --> 00:19:02,181
That's right, because I'm the best.
I know everything about St. Tail!

238
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,656
Though she's always getting away?

239
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:09,662
What did you say? I had a good reason
for letting her go this time!

240
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:12,336
I know.

241
00:19:15,282 --> 00:19:18,843
You said, "I don't want
to capture you with machinery!"

242
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,582
And you work so hard at it!
