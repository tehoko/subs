1
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:09,694
Then you also went
to the fortune teller Pandora...

2
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:11,200
Yes.

3
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:13,171
And when I came to...

4
00:00:13,318 --> 00:00:15,183
...the ring, which was
a family heirloom, was gone.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,782
It's the same trick as the other one.

6
00:00:18,596 --> 00:00:21,258
But, Sister! I'm sure of this!

7
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:24,300
The one who stole
the ring is St. Tail!

8
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:26,707
There's no doubt about it!

9
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:33,280
MOM'S ENEMY!
ROSEMARY'S CONSPIRACY

10
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:40,767
SERIAL ROBBERY
BY SAINT TAIL CONTINUES

11
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:44,483
This is the longest
it's gone in Seika City's history.

12
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:50,556
I've heard that all of the victims
are saying St. Tail did it.

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,401
I don't know anything about it...

14
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,371
What a terrible thing to do!

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,608
My dad says
he can't sleep at night.

16
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:00,984
I don't know...!

17
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:06,092
There's no way that
she would do these things!

18
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:21,563
Asuka Jr. ...

19
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:23,476
A warning note...

20
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:27,207
St. Tail's warning note
hasn't been delivered.

21
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:30,826
We had an agreement...

22
00:01:31,497 --> 00:01:33,260
...that she would give me
a warning note every time.

23
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:36,533
She's never broken the promise.

24
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:39,200
Promise...

25
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:41,879
Those newspaper articles...

26
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:43,789
I don't believe them!

27
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,833
Thank you, Asuka Jr.

28
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:58,417
It has to be hypnosis.

29
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:01,459
All of the victims are...

30
00:02:01,732 --> 00:02:04,963
...made to believe
that St. Tail stole their things.

31
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:09,504
That's the revenge
on the Mysterious Thief Lucifer.

32
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,308
In order to get
revenge on my mom...

33
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:12,820
...she's giving me trouble.

34
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:14,192
Why?!

35
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:15,261
Meimi.

36
00:02:16,198 --> 00:02:19,497
Even though I thought it was
disrespectful to your mother...

37
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:23,837
...I researched the old articles
about Mysterious Thief Lucifer.

38
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:29,026
This is...!

39
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:30,595
THIEF LUCIFER PUBLICLY
CHALLENGES ROSEMARY

40
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:34,163
It looks like
Mysterious Thief Lucifer's warning note.

41
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:37,300
Oh, Mom. What a showoff...!

42
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:39,907
In this article, Rosemary...

43
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:43,453
...seemed to be Lucifer's
opponent, I mean, rival.

44
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,426
Yeah. I heard
about her from Mom.

45
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,295
She was like a snake.

46
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:51,166
The person who resents
Lucifer can only be...

47
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,844
...this same person.

48
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,314
You're right. Mom returned
all of the items she had stolen.

49
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:00,126
But this Rosemary...

50
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:02,761
...has some connection
with that girl...?

51
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:06,639
I'm going to Pandora again.

52
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:09,940
I may find the location
of the victim's ring.

53
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:15,486
By the way, Seira,
how do you pronounce this?

54
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:32,636
FORTUNE TELLING

55
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:34,870
I'm really scared.

56
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:37,071
If the same thing
happens to me again...

57
00:03:39,556 --> 00:03:40,580
But I have to go in.

58
00:03:41,427 --> 00:03:43,258
For the sake
of St. Tail's reputation...

59
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:47,203
Excuse me...!

60
00:03:53,822 --> 00:03:56,222
Welcome!
I've been waiting for you!

61
00:03:56,394 --> 00:03:57,656
PANDORA'S ORIGINAL GOODS
MEDUSA CHAN

62
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,497
You don't need to be
that surprised! Right...

63
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:03,575
...Mom?

64
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:13,324
Mom...?

65
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:17,632
What...?

66
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,310
How cute!

67
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,051
Mom! You've got
to get rid of that habit.

68
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:26,755
You're so cute!

69
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:29,559
You look exactly like
Lucifer did at that age.

70
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:33,906
But cuteness is only skin deep.

71
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:45,098
Lucifer... She loved doing
things that people hated.

72
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:48,203
She always targeted
the item I was planning to take.

73
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:50,008
She was like a snake!

74
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:52,417
That's right! That's right!

75
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:55,389
I've heard that
somewhere before...

76
00:04:57,902 --> 00:05:00,302
AIthough I don't have
any grudge against you...

77
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:02,773
...you have to come along with me
so that I can get my revenge.

78
00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:06,240
Just curse the fates you were
born as Lucifer's daughter.

79
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,023
Excuse me...

80
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:09,420
Kabako...?

81
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:12,296
KABA (HIPPOPOTAMUS) KO

82
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:15,666
What did you say?

83
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:17,601
Oh, am I right?

84
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:20,316
You're Ms. Kabako Sendo,
also known as Rosemary, aren't you?

85
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,615
I learned how to read
your name from Seira.

86
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:24,716
Please don't address me
with my ridiculous real name!

87
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,797
Understand?!

88
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:30,696
That horrible
warning note from Lucifer...!

89
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:34,105
Because of that,
the public knew my real name...

90
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:35,378
...and people made fun of me!

91
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:36,543
That's right! That's right!

92
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:38,356
The humiliation...!

93
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:41,027
I've never, even for a second,
forgotten that feeling!

94
00:05:42,337 --> 00:05:45,898
Like mother, like daughter!
How hateful! I'll never forgive you!

95
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,079
I didn't mean anything by it at all!

96
00:05:48,517 --> 00:05:50,485
I just wanted to know
about the theft.

97
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,392
The stolen items are not here.

98
00:05:54,163 --> 00:05:57,724
We don't know anything
about the items St. Tail stole.

99
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,136
Right, Maju?

100
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,435
Right, Mom!

101
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:01,512
This mother and daughter...

102
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:03,676
All right, then!

103
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,485
Sorry to have disturbed you!

104
00:06:07,227 --> 00:06:08,660
Come back again!

105
00:06:09,732 --> 00:06:11,927
How infuriating!

106
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,363
I'm not afraid of revenge!

107
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:16,606
Who do they think they are?!

108
00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:18,274
Meimi, sorry to keep you waiting.

109
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:25,055
I checked for places
where a pair posing...

110
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:27,803
...as mother and daughter
have moved in recently.

111
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:29,639
This is the only place.

112
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,411
This is a monastery!

113
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,784
Yes. It's the old building
along the seashore.

114
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,990
It's not used now,
and it's supposed to be empty.

115
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:41,562
It's been for sale
for quite a while now.

116
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:44,808
But people thought it was creepy
and didn't want to get closer.

117
00:06:45,314 --> 00:06:46,975
If those two are there...

118
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:48,516
...the stolen items
must be there, too.

119
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:51,014
I'm going to get them back!

120
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:54,064
And I'll clear St. Tail's name!

121
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:59,168
For the sake of Asuka Jr., too,
who believes in me...!

122
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:11,528
Darn it! Someone else
must be using St. Tail's name.

123
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:15,035
She must have been forced to be
involved in such a strange case.

124
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,720
- That blimp!
- Something is written on it!

125
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,291
"Tonight I'm going to the monastery...

126
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:26,668
...to take the rings and other things
which are in the possession...

127
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:28,505
...of Kabako Sendo,
also known as Rosemary.

128
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:29,580
-St. Tail"

129
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:32,075
What's that?

130
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:33,582
It's St. Tail's warning note!

131
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:35,953
St. Tail!

132
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:42,369
I used the same
warning note as my mom's.

133
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:43,478
Isn't it nice?

134
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:44,815
Meimi...

135
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:47,484
Oh, you're worrying
about the location, aren't you?

136
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:50,057
Asuka Jr. can figure it out.

137
00:07:50,162 --> 00:07:51,186
It's not that.

138
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,594
Is it wise to show her real name?

139
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:01,509
Oh, no...!

140
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,188
I was only thinking about doing
the same thing as my mom did...!

141
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:17,383
She is indeed
Lucifer's daughter...

142
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:20,016
She has a lot of guts.

143
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:23,065
It doesn't matter whether
it's the mother or daughter!

144
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:24,399
I won't forgive you!

145
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:28,813
Your money's here!

146
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:31,519
Thank... Thank you...!

147
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:39,030
But who is Rosemary?

148
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,138
Her last few messages
have been difficult to understand...

149
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:47,853
What do you think you're doing?!

150
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:51,557
I am Rosemary.

151
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:53,896
How do you do, Mr. Detective?

152
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:56,837
You're so cute!

153
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:01,854
Rosemary?!

154
00:09:08,976 --> 00:09:12,173
This is jade dust...
It's pretty, isn't it?

155
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,476
Don't take your eyes off of it.

156
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:18,717
What's happening?
I can't move!

157
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,247
You don't need to worry about
not understanding what's going on!

158
00:09:42,353 --> 00:09:43,786
Cute little detective...

159
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,455
I'm inviting you to my house now.

160
00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:50,830
So what are you
going to do, St. Tail?

161
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:53,773
Your weak point
is now in my hands.

162
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,778
You angered me.

163
00:09:57,487 --> 00:10:00,081
You'll regret it,
and you'll wish you were dead.

164
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:18,491
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

165
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:24,614
One!

166
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:28,078
Two!

167
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,157
Three!

168
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,401
Be careful, Meimi.

169
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:54,906
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

170
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,586
May the blessings
of God be with us.

171
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:02,088
See you!

172
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:07,202
I wonder why...

173
00:11:07,748 --> 00:11:08,976
I have a bad feeling about this...

174
00:11:09,953 --> 00:11:10,920
Meimi...!

175
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:43,888
Asuka Jr. isn't here...

176
00:12:45,638 --> 00:12:47,128
Nor is his security staff...

177
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,273
They couldn't fiind this place?

178
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:56,616
You... didn't come...

179
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:06,986
The item you're looking for...

180
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:08,487
...is in here.

181
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:12,295
But no matter
how much you search here...

182
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,424
...the detective won't come.

183
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:17,904
Maju...!

184
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:20,407
What do you mean?!

185
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:22,946
Well...

186
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,884
You'll see...

187
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:58,295
Don't be misled, Meimi!

188
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,063
This is hypnosis!

189
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:01,233
It's an illusion!

190
00:14:05,521 --> 00:14:06,510
One!

191
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:08,860
Two!

192
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:11,728
Three!

193
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:16,303
lllusion!

194
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:33,844
She created
a wind with her magic...

195
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:36,018
...and pushed away
my hypnosis...!

196
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:47,046
Are you awake now?

197
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,220
Where am I?

198
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:54,288
Oh, weren't you listening?

199
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:55,592
You're in my house.

200
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,835
Never mind that. Look this way.

201
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:01,373
Can you tell who is next door?

202
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:04,050
St. Tail!

203
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:09,253
This is a one-way mirror.

204
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:11,631
They can't see us
from the next room.

205
00:15:12,107 --> 00:15:14,041
You'd better watch
closely from here...

206
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,107
...and see what happens next.

207
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:35,492
It's...

208
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:39,564
...Show...

209
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,469
...Time!

210
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,250
It's payback time!

211
00:15:50,194 --> 00:15:51,525
Curtain ghosts!

212
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,649
Don't come near me!

213
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,803
What are you going to do to her?

214
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:18,345
Run!

215
00:16:28,816 --> 00:16:31,808
I've gotten back
everything you stole.

216
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:34,751
Run!

217
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:37,030
Please run!

218
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,037
Now!

219
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,655
Everyone has something...

220
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:52,197
...that they don't want
other people to know...

221
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,003
You do, too, daughter of Lucifer.

222
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:07,261
That was loud.
It sounds like a storm.

223
00:17:07,704 --> 00:17:09,604
Don't worry, Eimi.

224
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,638
There is always an end
to everything and every storm.

225
00:17:13,017 --> 00:17:14,245
You're right.

226
00:17:15,522 --> 00:17:17,217
There is an end to everything.

227
00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:40,574
She's very near. Watch closely!

228
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:45,279
I'll do the same to you, St. Tail.

229
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,736
Until I catch you...

230
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:14,377
...don't get caught...!

231
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:20,202
All right!

232
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:33,888
You wanted to know
her identity, didn't you?

233
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:40,806
You're pleased, aren't you?

234
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:07,003
Why... Why...?!

235
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,684
Meimi!
