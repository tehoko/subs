1
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:07,916
-See you later!
-Bye!

2
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:12,620
Hey, Shota!

3
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:18,698
-Are you looking for UFOs again?
-You don't give up.

4
00:00:18,909 --> 00:00:20,501
That's my business!

5
00:00:20,713 --> 00:00:24,581
We're in the fifth grade now.
It's time you gave it up.

6
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:29,352
-Why? UFOs really exist.
-How can you believe that?

7
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,224
-Sure they do!
-They don't!

8
00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:32,423
-Do!
-Don't!

9
00:00:32,637 --> 00:00:35,606
-lf I say they do, they do!
-Show me some proof!

10
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:38,277
Right, proof. The proof!

11
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:42,475
Proof, proof, proof, proof!

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,749
-I'll show you.
-You're sure?

13
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,696
I'll show you for sure! For sure.

14
00:00:49,537 --> 00:00:54,702
THE UFO APPEARS!?
A TOWN IN PANIC!

15
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:56,707
Good morning!

16
00:00:57,353 --> 00:01:02,484
-Good morning, Kyoko, Ryoko!
-You saw the UFO last night?

17
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:05,626
The one in the morning paper?

18
00:01:05,837 --> 00:01:10,831
Meimi, don't you read the papers?
Here.

19
00:01:11,215 --> 00:01:15,675
A UFO? "Several eyewitnesses
in Seika City."

20
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:19,520
It says people saw a shiny object
flying in the sky.

21
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:23,499
-That's definitely a UFO!
-But why the city of Seika?

22
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:26,967
What else?
It's because St. Tail is here!

23
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,614
St. Tail is probably
a messenger from outer space!

24
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:37,960
Yeah, a thief who roams
the universe, right?

25
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,563
How stupid! Who says
she's a messenger from outer space?

26
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,808
-What a terrible way to put it.
-There's no such thing as aliens.

27
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,286
-Then what's this article about?
-An optical illusion!

28
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:56,492
It says many people saw it.
Can you still call it an illusion?

29
00:01:56,707 --> 00:02:00,336
An airplane, a shooting star...
Anyway, something else!

30
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:02,540
UFOs aren't scientific!

31
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:05,551
Science has yet to prove many things!

32
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,286
-Miss Haneoka, Mr. Asuka.
-Be quiet!

33
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:13,729
The two of you, use that energy
and go do your science homework.

34
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,776
Yes, Sister.

35
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:27,196
Meimi! Have you heard about this?

36
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:29,134
What is it?

37
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:34,103
"From the space shuttle to UFOs.
Cosmo World.

38
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:39,578
Popular event producer Yuji Kuroda
turns the Big Dome into outer space."

39
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:43,056
The UFO in the papers,
a guy took a photo of it.

40
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:45,030
Wow! Unbelievable!

41
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:48,872
And that photo will be exhibited
at this event.

42
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,015
You're saying you wanna
go and see it, right?

43
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,710
Of course not!

44
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:58,486
If I see it, I'll know if it's real
or not. And tomorrow's Sunday...

45
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:02,430
Good idea.
Let's go and check it out.

46
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:06,940
-Well, now, is this a date?
-Of course not!

47
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:13,089
Okay, we're ready. Go get Dad.

48
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:14,854
Sure!

49
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,695
-Dad, dinner's ready!
-Okay!

50
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,965
Is he outside?

51
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:27,922
That's strange. No one's here.

52
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:30,158
Ruby!

53
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:34,366
Isn't this great?

54
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:38,370
Wow! It's a new magic trick, right?

55
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:44,615
This is much thinner than the piano
cord I used. Can't see it, can you?

56
00:03:44,827 --> 00:03:48,285
Ruby, don't struggle.
Don't struggle so much.

57
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:54,003
Is she all right? Ruby!

58
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:58,240
Looks like the reeling mechanism
needs more work.

59
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:01,423
Sorry, sorry!

60
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:13,514
I said that to Seira,
but this is exciting!

61
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,085
Meimi!

62
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,621
Yes!

63
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,755
It's us!

64
00:04:18,963 --> 00:04:24,230
What's with the sour face?
Sorry we're not Asuka Jr.

65
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:27,001
Ryoko, what are you talking about?

66
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:30,843
-We heard about it, how it's a date.
-Of course not!

67
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:35,321
-Can we come along?
-Well, sure, why not?

68
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:39,325
What's up?

69
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,834
You guys came along too.

70
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:46,503
-This has to be enjoyed together.
-Right, right!

71
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,255
I guess you're right.

72
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:01,743
Not very many people are in here.

73
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:06,752
This model is also cheaply made.
There's no detail whatsoever.

74
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:08,895
Where's Asuka Jr.?

75
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,863
-Now that you mention it...
-Maybe he's stuck to something?

76
00:05:17,716 --> 00:05:19,411
Wow!

77
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,818
Hey, Asuka! Let's take a look
at the UFO photos.

78
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:37,413
-What's this?
-"The photos are being enlarged.

79
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:41,924
They will be shown on the last day
at the UFO summoning event."

80
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:46,060
There, you see? It's a fake
so they're delaying it.

81
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:50,336
No, they're probably having
an expert examine the photos.

82
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:53,074
I'll go ask someone!

83
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:55,580
Mr. Kuroda, what's going on?

84
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:59,697
You're not drawing a crowd.
At this rate, we'll be in the red.

85
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:04,896
Don't worry, a turnout will come on
the last day. No one will miss this.

86
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:06,943
You mean that UFO photo?

87
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:12,682
Yes, it's fabulous. It's the hottest
conversation piece in this town.

88
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:18,263
But shouldn't an expert examine it
before you show it to the public?

89
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:22,341
By the time we do that, the event
will be over. It'll be fine.

90
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,845
But you--

91
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,918
My job is to gather people.

92
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:32,084
I've planned, along with the photo,
an event to summon a real UFO.

93
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:35,829
It'll be a smash hit, that's for sure.

94
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:39,910
-Anyway, we're counting on you.
-Just watch.

95
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:47,057
It's the man in the picture.

96
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:53,628
But, sir, if we enlarge the photo,
everyone will know that it's a fake!

97
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,412
Stupid fool! You're talking too loud!

98
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,554
Hey, Meimi.

99
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:04,592
Why are you hanging around here?
Hurry up so we can see the UFO--

100
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:09,565
-What's wrong?
-You're the one who stepped on--

101
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:12,473
The UFO model's that way.
Let's go!

102
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,776
Kids nowadays are too mature.

103
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:17,252
Yikes!

104
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,163
You're talking about the UFO
in the papers?

105
00:07:23,773 --> 00:07:28,301
Yeah. I want to see a UFO so badly,
I always carry a camera.

106
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:33,112
But because of that,
my friends make fun of me, so I...

107
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:51,717
All right!

108
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:59,202
-Wow!
-That's neat!

109
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,608
Is this some sort of hoax?

110
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:05,752
It's real.
It was even in this morning's paper!

111
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:09,554
-It's probably the same UFO.
-Shota, you've done it!

112
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:11,495
Sure did.

113
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:14,604
Then it was just
a remote control airplane?

114
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:19,907
Yeah. I didn't expect it
to become such a big sensation.

115
00:08:20,422 --> 00:08:25,325
And then my friends took the photo
to Cosmo World without me knowing!

116
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:26,521
Oh, my.

117
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:29,999
And it's going to be
exhibited at that event.

118
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:35,646
-Have you asked for the photo back?
-Yes, I did! But...

119
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:42,185
My friends brought it in without
my permission, that UFO photo.

120
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:44,195
Oh, that one.

121
00:08:44,403 --> 00:08:50,069
It's just the thing for this event,
so we're putting it on exhibition.

122
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:55,379
I'm sorry. It's a fake.
So please return it to me.

123
00:08:55,593 --> 00:08:59,996
Too late now. We already advertised
that it'll be on exhibition.

124
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:02,261
But...

125
00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:06,773
You better not tell anyone
it's a fake. They'll never know.

126
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:10,516
That's unfair. Please return it.

127
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:15,355
I'll return it to you
when the event is over.

128
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:20,706
If only I hadn't taken that photo.

129
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:26,214
I understand. Let's pray.
I'm sure God is with you.

130
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:29,690
I see. So that's the story
behind it all.

131
00:09:30,364 --> 00:09:35,734
Shota regrets what he has done
and promises not to do it again.

132
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:40,504
Okay! The thief St. Tail shall get
that photo back for him.

133
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:19,954
This is...

134
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:24,864
"Tonight I'll be stealing
that UFO photo at the Big Dome.

135
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:27,441
-St. Tail"

136
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:38,595
St. Tail is after that photo.

137
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:43,339
Yes, so we'll be taking care
of the security for the photograph.

138
00:10:43,546 --> 00:10:45,036
I can use him.

139
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,454
I thought that if we could get a photo
to reveal St. Tail's identity...

140
00:10:51,662 --> 00:10:53,425
What would you do with it?

141
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:58,593
An event, of course. With that photo,
crowds will swarm to such an event.

142
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:03,042
Absolutely not! To make
St. Tail into such a spectacle!

143
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,384
Well, I'll leave the security to you.

144
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:11,155
The photograph is set
in that slide projector over there.

145
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,866
Weren't you having it enlarged?

146
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:18,045
There are limits to enlarging a photo.

147
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,879
We're going to project it
on a slide, like, bang!

148
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:25,993
Well, I've got things to prepare
so I'll be on my way.

149
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:31,237
Who's gonna let a guy like that
reveal St. Tail's identity?

150
00:11:36,454 --> 00:11:40,185
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

151
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,966
One!

152
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:50,578
Two!

153
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:54,520
Three!

154
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:13,124
May the blessings of God be with us.

155
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:23,335
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Cosmo World!

156
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,612
All of you here tonight will
witness a historical event!

157
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:33,389
The boy who took the photo we'll
be showing had these words to say:

158
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:38,563
"The UFO will definitely return
to retrieve this photo!"

159
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:40,542
There's more!

160
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:45,814
We've been informed that St. Tail
might appear to steal this photo!

161
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:49,589
Ladies and gentlemen,
have you brought your cameras?

162
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,072
What scum, saying a thing like that!

163
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:58,078
For those who photograph a UFO
or St. Tail's true identity...

164
00:12:58,286 --> 00:13:01,050
...we have big rewards prepared!

165
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:03,853
Now, let us begin!

166
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:18,887
Mr. Kuroda, there aren't
any rewards prepared.

167
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:24,260
It'll be hard for anyone to photograph
St. Tail's true identity.

168
00:13:24,473 --> 00:13:27,408
But what if someone
does photograph her?

169
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:29,342
I'll buy it in cash.

170
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,510
If we have that, I'll surely be able
to fill the Big Dome unlike before.

171
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:39,562
-But what about the UFO?
-Don't get your hopes up on that one.

172
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:44,104
Didn't you say that a UFO
will come to retrieve the photo?

173
00:13:44,313 --> 00:13:50,149
Just an act to arouse the audience.
And that photo, it looks like a fake.

174
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,389
That's a problem!
Let's cancel the event right now!

175
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,125
Hey, calm down.

176
00:13:56,405 --> 00:14:00,364
The only one who will be criticized
is the boy who took the photo.

177
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,071
We're only victims of a trick.

178
00:14:03,286 --> 00:14:07,723
And luck is on our side if
a crowd gathers, am I not right?

179
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:09,362
How could you--?

180
00:14:14,174 --> 00:14:17,337
-Mommy, when is the UFO coming?
-I'm not sure.

181
00:14:17,748 --> 00:14:20,842
-It won't come, will it?
-What's going on?

182
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:23,787
-Hurry up and summon the UFO!
-Yeah!

183
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:25,894
This is where we end this.

184
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:33,099
It looks like our UFO has decided
to make a sidetrack somewhere.

185
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,615
While we're waiting for its arrival,
we'll present the UFO photo--

186
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:40,588
It's the UFO!

187
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:44,993
The UFO appeared!

188
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:47,263
A picture, a picture!

189
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:49,239
We can get the reward!

190
00:14:50,314 --> 00:14:51,474
What's this?

191
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:55,516
Could it be a real UFO?

192
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,396
It's St. Tail! After her!

193
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:03,002
Everyone! St. Tail has appeared!

194
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,441
-What?
-St. Tail?

195
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:06,976
Where, where?

196
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:10,042
Hurry up and turn on the lights!

197
00:15:10,255 --> 00:15:14,419
-No good! The switch won't connect!
-Darn it!

198
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,363
There she is!

199
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:18,228
She's over there!

200
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:20,737
Don't let her escape!

201
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:28,244
-Are you all right, Asuka Jr.?
-Never mind me, get her!

202
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:29,889
Hold it!

203
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,860
There she is! Over there!

204
00:15:34,337 --> 00:15:35,827
Oh, no!

205
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:40,604
St. Tail!

206
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:51,165
St. Tail! This is
where the chase ends!

207
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:54,875
-What's going on here?
-I can't see a thing!

208
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,016
The flash won't reach
from this far away!

209
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:01,018
This is just fabulous!

210
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:06,527
Mr. Kuroda! This is big trouble!
A UFO has really appeared!

211
00:16:07,104 --> 00:16:11,473
What are you gonna do?
You know there aren't any rewards!

212
00:16:11,747 --> 00:16:14,011
-What's that?
-Now!

213
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,060
It's...

214
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,798
...showtime!

215
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:33,585
What's this?

216
00:16:49,423 --> 00:16:53,484
Well, Asuka Jr., I'll be
leaving with the photograph.

217
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,830
Darn! Don't think
I'll let you get away!

218
00:16:57,406 --> 00:17:01,035
-Stop it! Let go of me!
-I won't let go!

219
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:04,408
I can't stand this, you pervert!

220
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:09,217
-I'm not a--
-Never mind! Just let go of me!

221
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:16,437
Ouch.

222
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:25,687
Not again!

223
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:29,558
That hurts. I shouldn't use
experimental devices.

224
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:34,072
Hold it! Just as I thought!

225
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:37,810
Hold it!

226
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,987
-Open this door! I've taken a picture!
-Give me my reward!

227
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,643
-What is your plan now, Kuroda?
-Sir?

228
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:54,115
It's over.

229
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:10,178
Hope you get a picture
of a real UFO next time.

230
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,848
Hey, you!

231
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:18,891
How did you get that photograph?

232
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:22,872
-It fell from the sky.
-From the sky?

233
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:27,709
It's a fake.
I was in trouble because...

234
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:31,951
...they forced me to have it
revealed at the event.

235
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:34,098
I see.

236
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:37,865
So that's why. St. Tail.

237
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:47,891
Good morning, Asuka Jr. There was
another UFO appearance, wasn't there?

238
00:18:48,098 --> 00:18:52,592
That was just one of St. Tail's
tricks. UFOs don't exist.

239
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:55,368
You still don't believe?
You're stubborn.

240
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,481
In the first place,
anti-scientific things--

241
00:18:59,187 --> 00:19:03,055
-What is it? What's the matter?
-That.

242
00:19:06,903 --> 00:19:09,633
-Was that a--?
-UFO?

243
00:19:09,842 --> 00:19:11,867
-Wasn't it?
-Guess so.

244
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:16,845
Wait!
