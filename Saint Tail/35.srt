1
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:18,888
I'm so glad
it's nice weather, Seira.

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,833
You were looking forward...

3
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:22,766
...to this field trip very much.

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,405
Today let's forget about studying...

5
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:27,706
...and just have fun, Seira!

6
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:30,041
You're always forgetting
about schoolwork.

7
00:00:30,185 --> 00:00:33,586
Why don't you make a wish
at the "Tree of Happiness"?

8
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:38,492
Like, "Please make me
a little bit smart!"

9
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,156
It's none of your business.

10
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:42,668
all the girls are there now.

11
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:45,642
What's
the "Tree of Happiness"?

12
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:47,735
What?
Don't you know about it?

13
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,643
It's a tree in this park
which is popular right now.

14
00:00:50,887 --> 00:00:52,013
Really?

15
00:00:52,155 --> 00:00:53,747
Yeah! Let's go see it!

16
00:01:03,742 --> 00:01:04,709
This is it!

17
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:07,870
There's a rumor that if you
carve your wish on the tree...

18
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:09,143
...your wish will come true.

19
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,386
You can carve your name
along with the one you love.

20
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:20,430
There are a lot of scars...

21
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:22,934
Yeah... I feel sorry for it...

22
00:01:28,184 --> 00:01:32,621
GET BACK
THE "TREE OF HAPPINESS"!

23
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,656
Good morning!

24
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,120
They seem in love!

25
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:39,898
What? What? What is it?!

26
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:42,602
Oh, Meimi. It's about
the "Tree of Happiness."

27
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:43,833
The "Tree of Happiness"?

28
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:46,705
Yes! Hanako of Class C
carved in the tree...

29
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:50,478
...and wished for a date
with a boy she likes.

30
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:52,112
- Then...
- Then...?.!

31
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,358
Then it came true!

32
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:55,894
Wow! That's great!

33
00:01:56,398 --> 00:01:57,365
I envy her!

34
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:58,555
I'm going to go there again...

35
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,192
...and make more
and more wishes!

36
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:02,463
You have too many wishes.

37
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:03,769
That's not true!

38
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:07,079
I asked about Kosuke,
Kazuhiko, and Akio...

39
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:08,741
How about
Yasuhiro and Isshin?

40
00:02:08,986 --> 00:02:11,580
Well... Meimi,
did you make a wish?

41
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:15,388
No, I didn't because
I felt sorry for the tree.

42
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:17,989
Meimi, you worry too much.

43
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:20,000
You shouldn't think too much
about this kind of thing.

44
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:21,264
You should just enjoy it!

45
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:25,944
I thought you had made
a wish about Asuka Jr.

46
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:29,308
Don't be stupid! Why would
I want to wish about him?!

47
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,785
What about me?

48
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:33,392
You talked mean
about me as usual.

49
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:35,321
No, I didn't!

50
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:38,890
Didn't you make a wish at
the "Tree of Happiness"...

51
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:41,870
...that you could
catch St. Tail?

52
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:45,306
Stupid! I don't have
to ask God about it!

53
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,614
I'll catch her by myself!

54
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:51,253
That's why
he can't catch her at all.

55
00:02:51,358 --> 00:02:53,292
- That's right!
- You shut up!

56
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,573
Arborist?

57
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:05,310
Yes. I treat the trees...

58
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:08,541
...which are damaged
by disease and pollution.

59
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,684
You mean a tree doctor.

60
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,824
Yes.

61
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:13,654
About a year ago...

62
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,899
...in the grove on the hill
near Tachibana Nature Park...

63
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:21,394
... I found a white tree
which was dying from disease.

64
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:29,011
The disease had
progressed badly.

65
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,347
If nothing was done,
it appeared that it would fall...

66
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:32,517
...any minute.

67
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,716
Good... It still has a chance.

68
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,217
It took time.

69
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:28,717
But the tree fully recovered.

70
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,389
Your thoughts must
have reached the tree.

71
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:36,359
After that, I went there...

72
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:37,868
...to check on it
from time to time.

73
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:40,539
But when I went there today,
the tree was gone.

74
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:42,512
The tree was gone?

75
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:44,015
Yes.

76
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,047
The owner of Tachibana
Nature Park...

77
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:49,349
...took it out
by the roots. And...

78
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,555
Oh, that tree.

79
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:56,156
I want it to become the new
"Tree of Happiness. "

80
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:58,629
A new "Tree of Happiness"?

81
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:01,239
The current tree
has so many scars...

82
00:05:01,346 --> 00:05:02,904
...that we can't
use it anymore.

83
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:05,040
We were looking
for a new tree.

84
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:07,177
I beg you, Mr. Tachibana!

85
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,052
Please don't
continue with this!

86
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:10,591
Trees are living, too!

87
00:05:10,996 --> 00:05:12,258
You're hurting them!

88
00:05:12,631 --> 00:05:15,464
It's none of your business
what I do in my park.

89
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:19,336
Or are the trees saying
they're hurting?

90
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:22,546
Yes, they are!
You just can 't hear them!

91
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,542
That's stupid.

92
00:05:25,286 --> 00:05:28,449
The "Tree of Happiness"
is a money tree for this park.

93
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:32,556
Some come just to carve
their wishes on the tree.

94
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,757
So I have
no intention of stopping...

95
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,426
...no matter what you say.

96
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:43,072
It's best for trees to be
in their natural state.

97
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:46,844
But he's moving them
and carving them up...

98
00:05:47,157 --> 00:05:48,215
Don't worry.

99
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:52,054
I'm sure your prayers
have reached God.

100
00:05:55,404 --> 00:05:57,634
That's what the owner
of the park said?

101
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:59,732
Yes. According to Kudo...

102
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:02,904
...the tree will be planted
in the park tomorrow night.

103
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:04,384
Tomorrow night?

104
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:06,054
Yes.

105
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:07,144
So it's in time...

106
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:08,382
...for the opening
the day after tomorrow.

107
00:06:08,893 --> 00:06:11,327
Then what will happen to
the current tree in the park?

108
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:15,028
It's terrible,
but it will be disposed of.

109
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:16,295
No way!

110
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:19,134
It'll be replaced because
it isn't useful anymore...

111
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:21,676
Trees are not an instrument
for humans to make money.

112
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:25,274
So, Meimi, I would like you
to steal the tree.

113
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:27,112
all right, Seira.

114
00:06:27,592 --> 00:06:29,355
Count on St. Tail.

115
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,260
I'm home!

116
00:06:33,368 --> 00:06:34,858
Welcome back, Meimi!

117
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:40,838
Whose voice is that?

118
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:42,980
Meimi! It's me! Me!

119
00:06:46,724 --> 00:06:48,487
Ruby! You can...?!

120
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:53,325
Meimi, I'm Ruby!

121
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:56,368
Dad! What's that?!
Interesting!

122
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,642
It's a voice changer.

123
00:06:59,012 --> 00:07:00,445
I found it at a toy store.

124
00:07:00,814 --> 00:07:02,975
I thought I might
use it for my magic.

125
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:07,587
Meimi, your eyes
are like stars...

126
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:10,456
...of the first magnitude
in the night sky...

127
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:14,193
Oh, by the way...

128
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:15,567
...the park you went to
on your field trip the other day...

129
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:18,006
...was showcased on TV.

130
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:22,275
As you can see...

131
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:24,750
...nature remains
undisturbed here...

132
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:28,186
...and visitors can
observe rare plants.

133
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:32,228
Also, there are athletic
and cycling courses...

134
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:34,800
...and people of all ages
can find enjoyment here.

135
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,506
This is the owner
of the park, Mr. Tachibana.

136
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:41,677
Hello. I'm the owner,
Tachibana.

137
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,213
Over here...

138
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:46,449
...the "Tree of Happiness"
is very popular...

139
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:49,423
...because it can make
wishes come true.

140
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,556
I hope you can come
to Tachibana Nature Park...

141
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,069
...and carve your wishes...

142
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,142
...in the "Tree of Happiness."

143
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:00,209
He is advertising
the "Tree of Happiness " like this...!

144
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,648
But that park
has changed a lot.

145
00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:08,051
Yes. It used
to be a small park.

146
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:10,094
Is that right?

147
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:13,763
Now we have to pay
an expensive entrance fee.

148
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:17,801
We often
went there on dates.

149
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:21,448
It's no longer
the park of our memories.

150
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:24,981
But you haven't changed
since that time...

151
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:26,683
...and you're
just as close to me.

152
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:28,762
Of course, Eimi.

153
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:30,689
And will be forever.

154
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:36,002
Oh, well... I guess we'll leave
these young ones alone...

155
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:39,408
...and we should get going.
Right, Ruby?

156
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:43,613
You're still here, Meimi...!

157
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,460
I'm going now!

158
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,007
What's this?

159
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:00,015
Is it a delivery?

160
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:04,218
What the...?!

161
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,607
What?!

162
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:17,909
"Tonight I'm going
to Tachibana Nature Park...

163
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:20,207
...to get the 'Tree of Happiness.'"

164
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:22,549
It's a warning note from St. Tail!

165
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,257
There's no time to lose!

166
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:42,799
Once more...

167
00:09:43,144 --> 00:09:45,806
...I'm going to ask
Mr. Tachibana to stop.

168
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,454
Excuse me...!

169
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:57,123
That's strange. I wonder
if anyone is here.

170
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:03,372
We've got it at last!

171
00:10:03,482 --> 00:10:05,245
We had
a tough time getting it.

172
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:08,321
Let the rich guy know...

173
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,160
...that we've got the flower
he asked for.

174
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:15,400
It's...?!

175
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,644
It's a...!

176
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:44,689
This flower is designated
a national treasure!

177
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:48,521
And so is this flower here.

178
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:51,967
I don't believe it!

179
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:55,376
all of these are plants
that are nearly extinct.

180
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:58,450
Why are these here?

181
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:15,275
This guy again!
What a persistent fellow!

182
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:18,646
He's seen too much.

183
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:20,486
What should we
do with him?

184
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:22,253
He saw the secret.

185
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:24,530
If he tells anyone...

186
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:26,694
...we're selling the national
treasure plants...

187
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,237
He can't tell.

188
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:31,642
Now that he knows our secret,
we can't let him go.

189
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:33,845
I'm going to
the "Tree of Happiness"...

190
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:35,113
...to watch its replacement.

191
00:11:35,223 --> 00:11:37,521
Make sure you watch him
until I come back.

192
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:38,788
Yes, sir.

193
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:47,038
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

194
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:53,356
One!

195
00:11:55,963 --> 00:11:56,930
Two!

196
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:02,003
Three!

197
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:16,531
Be careful, Meimi.

198
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,727
Count on me.

199
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,805
Nothing is
impossible for St. Tail.

200
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:25,273
May the blessings
of God be with us.

201
00:12:29,158 --> 00:12:30,591
You're Mr. Tachibana,
aren't you?

202
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:36,868
Oh, welcome. I was
waiting for you, Asuka Jr.

203
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:38,464
Hello.

204
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:39,635
Anyway...

205
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,577
...the "Tree of Happiness"
that St. Tail is targeting...

206
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:44,718
...was planted
around here, I thought.

207
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,286
Oh, you mean the old tree.

208
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:49,658
It's over there
lying on the ground.

209
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:52,431
Why did you do that?

210
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,740
It has too many
scars to use.

211
00:12:55,977 --> 00:12:59,276
So we're replacing it
with that new one.

212
00:13:01,454 --> 00:13:02,853
Oh, then you're
returning the old tree...

213
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,184
...to its natural habitat.

214
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:05,259
No way we're going to do...

215
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:06,350
...something
so time-consuming.

216
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:09,261
We'll cut it up and make
benches or something.

217
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:12,570
What is he thinking?!

218
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:15,309
Is this something the owner
of a nature park would do?

219
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,791
St. Tail hasn't
shown up, has she?

220
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:25,794
I wonder if she gave up.

221
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:28,366
No. She'll definitely come...

222
00:13:28,805 --> 00:13:30,397
...since she sent
the warning note.

223
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,201
All right!

224
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:33,737
All right!

225
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:39,713
Okay. The transplant
is almost done.

226
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:44,153
Well, St. Tail didn't show up.
What a pity!

227
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,906
What happened?!
Why didn't you show up, St. Tail?!

228
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:55,887
From now on, I want this
new "Tree of Happiness"...

229
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,050
...to make a lot of money.

230
00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:01,263
To commemorate this event,
I should carve the first wish.

231
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:03,094
Let's see...

232
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:05,671
I wish that this park
becomes more prosperous...

233
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,646
What's that?!

234
00:14:12,822 --> 00:14:13,948
Whose voice is that?!

235
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:16,456
What's that voice?!

236
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:21,597
Ouch! It hurts!

237
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:23,799
You hurt me!

238
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,310
I won't forgive you!

239
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:29,945
It can't be true...!
The tree talked...?!

240
00:14:33,462 --> 00:14:35,760
Not yet.
The real show starts now.

241
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:42,269
It's...

242
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:46,241
...Show...

243
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:48,678
...Time!

244
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:57,071
Help me!

245
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:00,437
She has shown up.

246
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:01,945
Come out! St. Tail!

247
00:15:05,623 --> 00:15:07,181
There she is.
She's up in the tree!

248
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:12,760
One!

249
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,064
Two!

250
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:16,334
Three!

251
00:15:27,331 --> 00:15:28,389
Shoot!

252
00:15:32,941 --> 00:15:34,670
I'm taking
the "Tree of Happiness"!

253
00:15:35,347 --> 00:15:37,076
I won't let you leave!

254
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:42,382
I'm going to catch you
today for sure!

255
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:45,421
It's dangerous to run without
looking where you're going!

256
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:58,676
I'm going to catch you
next time for sure!

257
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:13,707
Mr. Tachibana.

258
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,658
Mr. Tachibana,
you're under arrest.

259
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:23,564
What... what are you
talking about?

260
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:26,597
Those two
confessed to everything.

261
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:27,711
What?!

262
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:31,612
You...!

263
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:40,999
Hello, Son!

264
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,330
Oh, hi, Dad!

265
00:16:43,642 --> 00:16:46,577
What are you doing here?

266
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,176
Isn't that Mr. Tachibana?

267
00:16:49,386 --> 00:16:52,480
He was using
the nature park as a cover...

268
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:54,821
...for selling
rare flowers illegally.

269
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,290
What?!

270
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:58,927
He's been
a suspect for a while.

271
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:01,465
We got the warrant
and came here, then...

272
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:03,301
You got a big bust.

273
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:07,108
No wonder. I thought
something was strange.

274
00:17:07,622 --> 00:17:08,850
Oh, Mr. Kudo.

275
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:10,351
Are you all right?

276
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:12,290
Yes. Thank you very much.

277
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:13,723
What happened to you?

278
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,534
I came to ask Mr. Tachibana...

279
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:17,261
...to stop the "Tree of Happiness"...

280
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,805
...and I was suddenly hit.

281
00:17:19,143 --> 00:17:20,337
Because he discovered
their secret...

282
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:22,414
...he was locked up.

283
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:25,043
But I'm glad that
your injury isn't serious.

284
00:17:25,222 --> 00:17:26,382
Would you like the police car
to give you a ride?

285
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:29,084
No. I want to clear my head
by walking home.

286
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:31,260
Thank you very much.

287
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:36,871
That's what it is. St. Tail.

288
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:44,952
I couldn't get
the tree back after all.

289
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,128
Even though I come here,
the tree won't be here...

290
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:09,728
I'm so glad... It's safe.

291
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,157
Did you read
today's paper?

292
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:23,252
Yes.

293
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:25,333
The owner Tachibana
was arrested.

294
00:18:25,436 --> 00:18:28,428
The City of Seika is going
to manage the park.

295
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:30,676
And Kudo replanted
the "Tree of Happiness"...

296
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,676
...and he's treating it.

297
00:18:38,294 --> 00:18:40,728
It is now prohibited...

298
00:18:40,832 --> 00:18:42,424
...to carve in
the "Tree of Happiness".

299
00:18:43,437 --> 00:18:45,064
From now on it is a symbol...

300
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:47,366
...of the importance
of natural life...

301
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:49,443
...and it is to be
loved by people.

302
00:18:51,185 --> 00:18:53,153
People's wishes
do come true...

303
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:55,755
...when they put
some effort into it.

304
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:59,722
That's quite a wise saying
coming from you!

305
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:00,824
I suppose so.

306
00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:03,497
But if I give her any praise,
she gets snobby. So I won't.

307
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,570
What do you mean?!

308
00:19:05,713 --> 00:19:06,680
Nothing.

309
00:19:06,915 --> 00:19:09,907
Please put a little more effort
into getting better grades.

310
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,755
Mind your own business!

311
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:19,460
Such good friends...
