1
00:00:08,494 --> 00:00:11,930
Hold it, St. Tail!

2
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:15,401
St. Tail! I won't let you get away!

3
00:00:16,077 --> 00:00:18,341
What's going on?

4
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:22,552
-You two go after that one!
-Yes, sir!

5
00:00:24,963 --> 00:00:28,160
Darn! Wait!

6
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:36,512
You thought I'd get tricked
with your magic?

7
00:00:36,722 --> 00:00:39,623
Today I'll get you for sure!

8
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,782
Darn it!

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,054
The next time, I'll have
complete data on you...

10
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,928
...and you won't get away!

11
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:05,940
STEAL THE MEMORABLE HARMONICA!

12
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:14,858
Miyuki, please cheer up.
I'm sure God is with you.

13
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:18,807
Yes, thank you very much.

14
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:29,498
Music competition?

15
00:01:30,104 --> 00:01:35,098
Yes. They're holding the Seika City
Youth Music Competition tonight...

16
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:39,115
...at the new hall that opened
on Bayside Street.

17
00:01:39,324 --> 00:01:42,418
And Miyuki is one
of the contestants, right?

18
00:01:42,865 --> 00:01:46,164
But a problem has come up.

19
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,136
What do you mean by a "problem"?

20
00:01:49,345 --> 00:01:54,112
Miyuki was supposed to play
a harmonica at the contest.

21
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:58,589
But a certain person has tricked her
and taken her harmonica.

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,896
Tricked her and taken it?

23
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:03,902
Yes.

24
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,907
FUKUYAMA MUSIC INSTRUMENTS

25
00:02:06,115 --> 00:02:08,777
To have the harmonica tuned...

26
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:12,616
...Miyuki took it
to a music store on First Avenue.

27
00:02:13,097 --> 00:02:17,261
A music store on First Avenue
means it's the shop owned...

28
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:21,136
...by Mr. Fukuyama,
one of the city's wealthy citizens.

29
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:24,680
But Miyuki's harmonica was switched...

30
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:28,154
...with a fake one by that Fukuyama.

31
00:02:35,077 --> 00:02:37,511
She isn't the only one he's deceived.

32
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:41,948
He's tricked others, taken
their instruments and sold them.

33
00:02:42,126 --> 00:02:44,720
What an unforgivable thing to do!

34
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,763
Miyuki's harmonica is
a rare foreign-made one...

35
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:51,671
...given to her by her late father.

36
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,145
She's used it
since she was little, so--

37
00:02:55,355 --> 00:02:59,189
She won't perform as well
on another harmonica.

38
00:02:59,397 --> 00:03:05,233
Right. You have to get her harmonica
back by the time the contest begins.

39
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:10,608
We have to help Miyuki give a
successful performance, no matter what!

40
00:03:14,396 --> 00:03:17,331
I'm starved.
Let's grab a few hamburgers.

41
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:22,769
-I'll pass on it today.
-Then how about a game?

42
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:28,419
No, I've got some things to do.
Sorry, but I'm heading home. See you.

43
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:44,284
St. Tail? This way!

44
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:51,393
Rats! She's teasing me!

45
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:56,171
NICE JOB - ST. TAIL

46
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:59,181
Ouch!

47
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:04,161
"Tonight I'm taking a harmonica
in the First Avenue music store."

48
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,903
What? St. Tail, you--!

49
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:12,005
-Dad!
-Son, sorry, but your dinner's pizza.

50
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,678
No time for dinner!
Tonight, St. Tail's gonna--

51
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:20,628
Calling me in for backup when
I'm off duty. What a rotten deal.

52
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,603
The First Avenue music store,
St. Tail's--

53
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:28,546
Okay, okay.
Oh, I almost forgot something.

54
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:31,591
A photo of the man we're guarding.

55
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:36,028
The chairman of the panel of judges
for the music competition.

56
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:40,232
Mr. Wilson, famous composer
and competitor in music contests.

57
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:44,211
Now I've got to involve myself
in international affairs.

58
00:04:44,423 --> 00:04:47,290
I better not forget
to get his signature.

59
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,693
Wait, Dad! Darn it!

60
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,670
Please forgive me
for not being finished.

61
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,609
My, that's a cute doll!

62
00:04:58,854 --> 00:05:00,151
Hello.

63
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:03,594
-This is Daddy.
-That's right!

64
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,296
I'm going to be putting on a magic
show at the hall on Bayside Street.

65
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:11,502
The hall on Bayside Street?

66
00:05:12,117 --> 00:05:15,177
Yeah, it's a magic show
at such a grand hall...

67
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,349
...that I've got to put together
quite a gimmick.

68
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:23,001
So I'm using miniatures
to plan out the whole setup.

69
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:27,006
-What magic will you be doing?
-A great escape act.

70
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:30,177
A great escape act? Wonderful!

71
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:35,122
There's a little escape route
under the stage of that hall.

72
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,994
I'm planning to use it.

73
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,798
And it's called "Escape From Flames."

74
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,878
-An escape from water may be better.
-You have a point.

75
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:47,317
With Mom's ideas
and Dad's magic put together...

76
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:50,893
...it'll probably be a wonderful show!

77
00:05:52,303 --> 00:05:56,364
-Ruby expects it to be fabulous too.
-Thank you, Ruby.

78
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:04,384
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

79
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,169
One!

80
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:14,642
Two!

81
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:19,248
Three!

82
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:35,318
Miyuki is scheduled
to perform at 8:00.

83
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:39,032
8:00. I've got to hurry
or I won't make it!

84
00:06:39,238 --> 00:06:42,105
Good luck, Meimi.

85
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:48,078
May the blessings of God be with us.

86
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:54,024
What? The schedule has changed?
That's a problem. What's going on?

87
00:06:54,237 --> 00:06:59,641
Mr. Fukuyama, I simply will not
be able to meet you at your shop.

88
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:03,649
Actually, my next performance
was suddenly moved up...

89
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:08,157
...and I must leave Japan immediately
after tonight's competition.

90
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:10,431
I understand.

91
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,871
Then I will take the instrument
down to the hall.

92
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:18,608
Oh, that would be excellent.

93
00:07:18,823 --> 00:07:22,418
Well, then, Mr. Fukuyama.

94
00:07:22,631 --> 00:07:26,397
Mr. Wilson, we will be arriving
at the hall soon.

95
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,221
-Mr. Fukuyama, isn't it?
-What do you want, kid?

96
00:07:36,428 --> 00:07:40,865
I'm Asuka Jr. and I was commissioned
to help catch St. Tail.

97
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:44,063
I received a notice
that St. Tail will come...

98
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:47,111
...to steal a harmonica in this shop.

99
00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:52,278
St. Tail or Hail or whatever, I don't
know about it! Go home, I'm busy!

100
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:54,891
That won't do.

101
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:58,560
You will cooperate
in staking this place out.

102
00:07:58,776 --> 00:08:03,611
That's an official investigation
from the mayor! Do as you please.

103
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,879
Okay, now...

104
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:12,292
That St. Tail.
So that's what she's after.

105
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,134
St. Tail.

106
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:31,035
She can have any harmonica
in the shop she wants.

107
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:44,461
The stolen instruments are
all stored right here!

108
00:08:49,118 --> 00:08:52,952
7:00. Okay, come from wherever
you want, St. Tail!

109
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:04,239
St. Tail!
You won't get the harmonica!

110
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:09,383
What? Hey, the harmonica is
over here, you know!

111
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:16,330
It's that magic again. According
to my analysis, the real one is here!

112
00:09:20,218 --> 00:09:24,450
That's strange. The storage
room door was left open.

113
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:31,198
You're kidding. According to Seira,
the harmonica should be here!

114
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:34,207
Hold it, St. Tail!

115
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,717
Oh, no!

116
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:38,650
You won't escape today!

117
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:43,057
Where can Miyuki's harmonica be?

118
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:09,678
Fukuyama!

119
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:15,431
That wooden box! Miyuki's harmonica
is probably in there.

120
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,515
Where the heck is he going?

121
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:30,361
Rats! I won't let her get away!

122
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:49,303
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for attending...

123
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:54,073
...the Seika City Youth Music
Competitions this evening.

124
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:58,286
Tonight's purpose is
to create artists of the future.

125
00:10:58,497 --> 00:11:03,230
We offer an opportunity to study
abroad to one outstanding performer!

126
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:07,942
Well, then, let me introduce to you
our panel of judges!

127
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:23,167
That's the Bayside Street Hall.
What? He can't be going in there!

128
00:11:29,998 --> 00:11:35,903
Now I'm pleased to introduce the
world-renowned composer, Mr. Wilson!

129
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,913
Mr. Wilson is chairman of the panel
of judges for this competition!

130
00:11:41,123 --> 00:11:46,060
It is time to begin our competition.
Entry number one!

131
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:49,032
A junior at Seika High School...

132
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,233
...Megumi Hirose will be displaying
her talents on the piano!

133
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,029
Darn! Where's that St. Tail gone?

134
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:04,532
What? That's the--!

135
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:18,586
The first half is now complete.
We will take a 10-minute intermission.

136
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:30,015
Excuse me, Mr. Wilson.
May I have a word with you?

137
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,993
-And you are?
-Fukuyama. I called you earlier.

138
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:41,506
Oh, I appreciate you coming here!

139
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:45,712
Well, I don't know if you will
find anything you like...

140
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:48,727
...but I think it will be
worth your while.

141
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,869
I look forward to it.

142
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:55,442
I already prepared the instruments
below the stage of this hall.

143
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,445
Oh, thank you!

144
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:04,789
He's planning to sell
Miyuki's harmonica to Wilson here.

145
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:06,402
That won't happen!

146
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:10,376
-Dad!
-Son! What are you doing here?

147
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:14,344
It looks like St. Tail's
sneaked into this hall!

148
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,349
St. Tail, you said?

149
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:20,622
Yeah. She said she'd take a harmonica
from the music store...

150
00:13:20,837 --> 00:13:23,237
...but I don't know what's going on.

151
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:24,501
A harmonica.

152
00:13:24,713 --> 00:13:29,673
Ladies and gentlemen, the second half
of the competition will begin soon.

153
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,757
Please return to your seats.

154
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:36,390
Son, we'll talk later.

155
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:44,143
St. Tail is definitely planning
to start something here.

156
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:51,218
Where in this hall could St. Tail
try to pull something off?

157
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,868
Under the stage!

158
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:04,323
It's no good. I can't perform
properly on this harmonica.

159
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,532
Miss Miyuki Morishita, you're to
appear soon. Please get ready.

160
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:12,303
Yes.

161
00:14:27,615 --> 00:14:29,640
I found it!

162
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:41,066
Asuka Jr.!

163
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:50,423
My data is correct.
St. Tail will show up if I wait here.

164
00:14:53,437 --> 00:14:56,065
Next we have Miyuki Morishita...

165
00:14:56,277 --> 00:15:00,338
...a student at St. Paulia School,
performing on her harmonica.

166
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:06,487
What a fix. What should I do?

167
00:15:08,704 --> 00:15:10,296
That's--

168
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:14,807
That's it! The escape route
Dad was talking about.

169
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:17,917
Here we go!

170
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,659
Where did this flower come from?

171
00:15:24,304 --> 00:15:26,169
Now's my chance!

172
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:29,635
St. Tail!

173
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:33,580
Hold it, St. Tail! Darn it!

174
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:50,013
-What's the matter? Are you all right?
-It's no good.

175
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:57,034
I can't perform unless
I use my father's harmonica.

176
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:02,906
Cheer up, Miyuki!

177
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:04,882
St. Tail!

178
00:16:05,092 --> 00:16:06,855
-St. Tail?
-Wow! Really?

179
00:16:07,464 --> 00:16:12,333
Miyuki, your precious harmonica
is here in the hall!

180
00:16:12,742 --> 00:16:14,801
She's over there!

181
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:24,529
It's...

182
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:28,531
...show...

183
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:31,576
...time!

184
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,161
-What's this?
-What's going on?

185
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,395
Son!

186
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,551
Yeah!

187
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:56,466
What are these instruments?

188
00:16:57,104 --> 00:17:01,632
-Don't touch them! Stop it!
-Mr. Fukuyama?

189
00:17:04,854 --> 00:17:07,846
Don't touch any of my instruments!

190
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:11,155
Ouch! Your instruments?

191
00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:15,361
This is the violin that
I asked Mr. Fukuyama to repair.

192
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:17,068
And that's my flute!

193
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:21,282
Stop it! These are my instruments!

194
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:24,318
So that's it! Fukuyama stole these!

195
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,761
-Son, what's this all about?
-He's the one!

196
00:17:29,908 --> 00:17:32,934
They were probably stolen by Fukuyama!

197
00:17:33,148 --> 00:17:35,275
What?

198
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,384
Darn it!

199
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:40,493
Hold it!

200
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:49,235
Hey, are these instruments
that you've stolen?

201
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:51,609
Well, how about it?

202
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:56,653
Ouch! Yes, that right!

203
00:17:58,436 --> 00:18:01,132
Darn it! St. Tail got away!

204
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:10,517
Mr. Fukuyama, were you planning
to sell me instruments like that?

205
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,130
Were you attempting to deceive me?

206
00:18:13,336 --> 00:18:17,796
You better think of how those
whose instruments were stolen feel.

207
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:21,812
Mr. Wilson, I will take
the responsibility of returning...

208
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,785
...these instruments to their owners.

209
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:33,096
Miyuki, now you'll be able
to play your best on the harmonica.

210
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,577
St. Tail, thank you!

211
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:39,846
Miss Miyuki, please perform your best.

212
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,552
The audience is eager
to hear you play your harmonica.

213
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:46,033
Yes, sir, I'll do my best!

214
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:54,913
Darn it! She's escaped again!
