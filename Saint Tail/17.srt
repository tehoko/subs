1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:09,139
How about going to buy chocolate
after school today?

2
00:00:09,347 --> 00:00:11,611
It's almost Valentine's Day.

3
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:15,550
I'll have to give some
obligation chocolates this year.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,288
-Meimi, you're going too, right?
-Valentine's. What shall I do?

5
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:23,301
Aren't you giving
Asuka Jr. chocolate?

6
00:00:23,543 --> 00:00:25,170
What? You're kidding!

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,213
What's that?
Is that how you really feel?

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,823
Someone's giving me chocolate?
"True love" chocolate?

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,830
You've got it wrong!
It's obligation chocolate!

10
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:38,767
I don't care which it is...

11
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:43,275
...but a better gift would be
a meat bun or octopus fritters.

12
00:00:43,484 --> 00:00:47,614
What a kid! Valentine chocolates
aren't a 3:00 snack!

13
00:00:47,827 --> 00:00:50,660
You won't get any
"true love" chocolates!

14
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:53,835
-Be quiet!
-What do you mean, be quiet?

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,600
-What's it to you?
-What do you mean?

16
00:00:56,813 --> 00:00:58,610
Jeez!

17
00:00:59,218 --> 00:01:02,483
Asuka, what are you doing?

18
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:07,453
That's no way to treat a lady.
You've got to be gentle.

19
00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:11,401
It's Tohru Ijuin!

20
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:14,609
Hey, who's Tohru Ijuin
supposed to be?

21
00:01:14,817 --> 00:01:18,719
You don't know?
Right now, Tohru Ijuin is...

22
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:22,219
...an ultra-popular guy
among the freshmen.

23
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:26,233
Sure! He models, always
in the latest magazines.

24
00:01:26,442 --> 00:01:29,741
Then how could such a guy
know Asuka Jr.?

25
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:31,677
Who knows?

26
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:35,518
Oh, good morning!
I'm a freshmen in class A.

27
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,154
Tohru Ijuin.

28
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:47,107
THE HEART THIEF ON
ST. VALENTINE'S DAY??

29
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:56,358
Just know that I'm not friends with
this guy. We live near each other--

30
00:01:56,572 --> 00:02:00,372
That's mean!
We played a lot together as children.

31
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,912
Be quiet, don't follow me!

32
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,455
In the first place, you're younger!
So why are you bigger than me?

33
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:12,130
Asuka, you're at it again?
He's always like this.

34
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:16,001
He absolutely despises my good looks.

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,157
-Pardon me! You're Tohru Ijuin, right?
-Yes, I am.

36
00:02:24,363 --> 00:02:28,163
-Isn't she from another school?
-I think so.

37
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:32,502
-Please enjoy these cookies I made.
-Thanks.

38
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:35,682
And will you let me take your picture?

39
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:38,048
-Sure.
-Thank you!

40
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:44,094
Wait a minute! I look best diagonally
from the right, at a 30-degree angle.

41
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:47,741
Okay! I understand.

42
00:02:47,946 --> 00:02:52,315
This is stupid.
Let's go and leave this guy.

43
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:59,226
Hey, wait for me, Asuka!

44
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,433
Asuka! Please wait for me!

45
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:05,203
Yeah, just like that!

46
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,485
"There is nothing stronger
than a mother's love.

47
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:14,254
I am prepared for anything.

48
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:19,595
The mountain that you see
over there is Mt. Asahi."

49
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,340
Well, we shall stop here.

50
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:27,546
We will have a test next week
on today's lesson. Review it well.

51
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:31,563
-What?
-You're joking!

52
00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:45,987
Can you lend me your English notebook?
I didn't take any notes.

53
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:47,463
Well...

54
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:51,163
Hey, Tohru! Hurry up
or I'll leave without you!

55
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:54,712
Yeah. Give me a minute!
Is it no?

56
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,479
It's okay.

57
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,728
Here, this is it.

58
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:07,266
Thank you!
I'll return it tomorrow!

59
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:15,819
This is the English notebook.
Wait! That's the wrong one!

60
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:22,295
Oh, no, what am I going to do?

61
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,542
-What? You're gonna buy that much?
-But they're all obligations.

62
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:31,157
And who's the true love?

63
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:35,265
That's a secret!
And, Meimi, what about you?

64
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:36,938
What? Me?

65
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:44,976
-Who'd give him anything?
-Meimi, how about you?

66
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:47,387
That's my secret too!

67
00:04:47,597 --> 00:04:50,122
Unfair, you've all got secrets!

68
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:53,305
-So, Ryoko, yours is...?
-Me?

69
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:57,377
You keep asking about us,
but what about you?

70
00:04:57,585 --> 00:05:00,952
Isn't it obvious? It's...

71
00:05:01,158 --> 00:05:02,455
Yes?

72
00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:04,151
A secret.

73
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,876
So you lent him the wrong notebook?

74
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:15,152
Yes, exactly.

75
00:05:15,355 --> 00:05:19,223
That notebook is the one
I use as a diary...

76
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,864
...to write my daily thoughts in.

77
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,370
In that notebook,
I've written many poems...

78
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,143
...thinking about Tohru.

79
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:35,624
If Tohru should see any of that...

80
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:41,065
...I'd be so embarrassed
I wouldn't be able to live!

81
00:05:41,543 --> 00:05:46,537
Don't worry.
I'm sure God will lend you a hand.

82
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,002
Get a notebook back from Tohru Ijuin?

83
00:05:58,546 --> 00:06:00,912
Right. And it has to be today.

84
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:04,985
Before he gets a chance
to look at that notebook.

85
00:06:05,193 --> 00:06:06,717
Oh, I see.

86
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,094
Kanako Shimamura is in love with him.

87
00:06:11,306 --> 00:06:14,469
But she's afraid
to have him find out.

88
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:19,946
This would be the chance to tell him.
And it's almost Valentine's Day.

89
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:23,887
You may be right, but...

90
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:30,163
A boy as popular as Tohru would
never even give me a second thought.

91
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:34,816
And I'm happy just to
be able to look at him.

92
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:40,586
There are many girls who are unable
to honestly display their feelings.

93
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,235
Meimi, you're probably...

94
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,407
Right?

95
00:06:46,814 --> 00:06:51,114
I understand. Right!
St. Tail is a supporter of girls.

96
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:54,622
I will get that notebook
back for Kanako.

97
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,627
ART ROOM

98
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:05,909
-Let's clean up quickly and go home!
-Yeah.

99
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:11,358
Jeez, what a filthy classroom.

100
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:18,438
What's this?

101
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:25,853
"NOTE" GETS CHANGED
TO "HEART"

102
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:27,530
Ouch.

103
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:29,360
It's a...

104
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,398
Tonight I will be stealing
Tohru Ijuin's heart away.

105
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:36,843
St. Tail!

106
00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:40,418
His heart?

107
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,753
What about his heart?

108
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:48,493
-What are you doing here?
-Let's go home together, Asuka.

109
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,304
Never mind that. Look.

110
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:57,282
"Tonight I will be stealing
Tohru Ijuin's heart away. -St. Tail"

111
00:07:57,896 --> 00:08:00,797
-What's this about?
-That's my question!

112
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:04,869
What does it mean?

113
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:09,037
If it says "heart"...
You're kidding! My heart?

114
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:14,657
This heart? She's gonna perform
open-heart surgery on me?

115
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:18,925
Of course not, you idiot!
Think seriously.

116
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,236
For example, maybe you have
a pet cat or dog named Heart.

117
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:26,714
-No, only a turtle named Samantha.
-I see.

118
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:29,523
Then what could it mean?

119
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:33,187
What could St. Tail
want to steal from you?

120
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:35,696
Well...

121
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:41,411
Heart, heart, heart...

122
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,647
That's it!
I know what it is, Asuka!

123
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:48,523
What is it? What's she gonna steal?

124
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,363
To put it simply...

125
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:54,839
...St. Tail has fallen in love
with me, and tonight she's coming...

126
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:58,609
...to flirt with me
and steal my heart away.

127
00:08:58,824 --> 00:09:01,793
-Think seriously!
-I'm serious!

128
00:09:01,997 --> 00:09:05,865
Besides, what else could
"steal my heart away" mean?

129
00:09:06,072 --> 00:09:09,098
Stupid. That's just stupid!

130
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:12,811
Asuka, what are you so upset about?

131
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,616
Asuka! Could you be jealous
of how I attract all the girls?

132
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,297
Be quiet!

133
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,663
That St. Tail, with a guy like this.

134
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:25,342
I, Tohru Ijuin...

135
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:29,049
...shall allow my heart to be stolen!

136
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,460
-What's wrong?
-Don't talk to me!

137
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:53,828
Hey, wait a minute.

138
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,074
Where are you taking me?

139
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,679
Where else? To buy a present.

140
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:03,321
We're going to buy a present
to give St. Tail.

141
00:10:03,526 --> 00:10:07,018
A present? Look here!
What are you thinking?

142
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:12,263
St. Tail is coming to steal
my heart away, you know.

143
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:16,005
Wouldn't it be rude
not to be prepared for it?

144
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:18,744
Imbecile! She's a thief!

145
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,019
Never mind. Just tell me
what gift would make her happy.

146
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,531
How should I know?

147
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:33,039
Okay, I can't be
dragging my feet here.

148
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:43,363
That wonderful chocolate smell!

149
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:48,537
-Don't look yet.
-Why? What's wrong with it? Delicious!

150
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:53,053
I said no. I haven't put
the finishing touch on it yet.

151
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:55,561
The finishing touch?

152
00:10:56,737 --> 00:10:59,069
A special flower.

153
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:02,970
With lots of love! Sprinkle!

154
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:05,448
I see.

155
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:09,493
You're right. This is delicious!

156
00:11:09,697 --> 00:11:13,463
-Isn't it?
-I wonder why.

157
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:19,476
Listening to them is embarrassing.
Isn't that so, Ruby?

158
00:11:22,324 --> 00:11:25,521
Aren't I right? Valentine's Day.

159
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:29,963
Ruby, do you have someone
to give chocolates to?

160
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:49,140
I've been waiting for you.
Well? Don't I look great?

161
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:52,647
Hey, what are you up to, anyway?

162
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:55,083
What are you talking about?

163
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:59,594
This is the proper etiquette
for receiving a lady.

164
00:12:00,872 --> 00:12:05,400
Kanako, it's dinnertime!
Come down here!

165
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:08,607
Yes! I'll be right there!

166
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:17,563
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

167
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:23,573
One!

168
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:27,682
Two!

169
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:31,664
Three!

170
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,526
Please be careful, Meimi.

171
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:51,032
Yes, I know!

172
00:12:53,348 --> 00:12:56,977
May the blessings of God be with us.

173
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:06,330
You can stay,
but please don't get in the way.

174
00:13:06,543 --> 00:13:08,977
I know.

175
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:13,276
St. Tail, come if you dare.

176
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,015
I'll get you for sure.

177
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:19,357
Who would give St. Tail
to a creep like him?

178
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,765
My style!

179
00:13:22,744 --> 00:13:24,507
She's here!

180
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:25,908
Wait, Tohru!

181
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:28,743
Welcome!

182
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:33,695
What's the matter, Tohru?

183
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:38,431
It's a present, Asuka!

184
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:42,842
Wait a minute, idiot!
Don't bring that in here!

185
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,513
But why--?

186
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:51,055
What did I tell you?! Idiot!

187
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:56,778
It's about time.

188
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:01,517
Quick! Open the window!

189
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:05,487
Is that you, St. Tail?

190
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:10,170
-This must be it.
-St. Tail!

191
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,777
Please steal my heart!

192
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,256
-Why are you running away?
-What's going on here?

193
00:14:19,496 --> 00:14:22,260
Where are you?
Where did you go, St. Tail?

194
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,738
Please steal my heart!

195
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:27,205
What? Steal his heart?

196
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:30,845
St. Tail!

197
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:35,958
Stop it! I'm not St. Tail!

198
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:38,699
What?

199
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:41,803
Hold it, St. Tail!

200
00:14:42,912 --> 00:14:44,903
St. Tail!

201
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,783
Do you love Tohru that much?

202
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:53,422
What's he mixed-up about?

203
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:56,770
I'm taking the notebook,
just as I told you!

204
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:59,243
Notebook?

205
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:09,192
Oh, it's not "heart."
It's "notebook."

206
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:13,230
-See you around!
-I won't let you get away!

207
00:15:13,442 --> 00:15:15,273
Asuka!

208
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:24,788
St. Tail!

209
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:27,794
Steal my heart!

210
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:40,251
-You're in the way!
-No, you're in the way!

211
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:43,401
I'm gonna catch St. Tail!

212
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,240
Asuka, up ahead!

213
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:57,054
My heart, please steal it!

214
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:05,342
I'm pretty sure that
Kanako's house is in this area.

215
00:16:09,393 --> 00:16:11,486
St. Tail!

216
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:16,195
Please wait! My heart!

217
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,644
Something's going on outside.

218
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:23,113
-St. Tail!
-I'll go look.

219
00:16:34,913 --> 00:16:37,313
Please wait!

220
00:16:37,752 --> 00:16:39,811
Please wait!

221
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,444
I give you my heart.

222
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,584
Tohru.

223
00:17:01,202 --> 00:17:03,067
You're cute.

224
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:08,072
I've made up my mind!

225
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:14,987
Okay!

226
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:21,901
Hold it, St. Tail!

227
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:29,357
What's happening?

228
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:37,403
Now you're caught!

229
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:40,137
Darn it!

230
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:48,923
I'll remember this, St. Tail!

231
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:52,935
You won't get away from me next time!

232
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:14,810
What happened to you yesterday?
You said you'd buy chocolate with us.

233
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:19,187
Oh, sorry about that!
Something urgent came up.

234
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:24,027
Good morning, Asuka Jr.!
St. Tail got away again?

235
00:18:24,242 --> 00:18:27,905
Be quiet! I almost had her!

236
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:33,350
If only that ship hadn't passed!
Next time, I'll get her for sure!

237
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:37,999
Asuka! Asuka, good morning!

238
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,274
Good morning!

239
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,179
-Kanako?
-Yes?

240
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:48,320
-Where are your glasses?
-I changed to contact lenses.

241
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,985
She's much cuter this way, isn't she?

242
00:18:53,337 --> 00:18:56,204
Hey, what's going on?

243
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:59,776
My heart was stolen,
just like the notice said.

244
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:01,349
By St. Tail?

245
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:04,045
Of course not! By Kanako!

246
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,251
Is that so?

247
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:10,594
You better hurry too,
or you'll be late for school.

248
00:19:11,408 --> 00:19:12,841
-But...
-Really.

249
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:14,603
What a guy!

250
00:19:14,814 --> 00:19:18,648
We're the happiest people alive!
