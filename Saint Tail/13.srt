1
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:12,705
Ah... I wish there was a
great scoop somewhere...

2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,451
Hazama Residence

3
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:21,531
Come on, hurry up!

4
00:00:21,568 --> 00:00:22,592
I am!

5
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:29,678
Looks like we did it.

6
00:00:30,185 --> 00:00:35,748
Yeah. The old lady didn't want anyone
to know about this mirror...

7
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:39,664
and once we put it up in
Thursday's auction, we'll be rich!

8
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:41,433
I hope we get a good price.

9
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:42,506
We will.

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,934
What's this...?

11
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:47,183
You got the appraisal?

12
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:50,186
Right here.
Hurry up and drive.

13
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:50,782
Okay.

14
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:52,454
Thieves...?!

15
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:04,645
This is my scoop!!

16
00:01:05,222 --> 00:01:10,592
Mystical Princess Rosa's Mirror

17
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,250
My, it's such a finely crafted mirror!

18
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:31,666
It was made in the 17th century
for Princess Rosa of Reyche.

19
00:01:31,774 --> 00:01:34,766
No wonder...
it's such a magnificent mirror.

20
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:36,539
The truth is, last night...

21
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:40,042
the mirror was stolen
along with its appraisal form.

22
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:45,595
There is a lovely legend regarding
the princess who owned this mirror.

23
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:51,004
Antique collectors around the
world are anxious to possess it.

24
00:01:51,948 --> 00:01:56,783
If the word of its theft gets out...

25
00:01:56,824 --> 00:02:01,625
I fear the collectors will do
anything to get their hands on it.

26
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:08,197
I merely want to live out my
life in peace with my mirror.

27
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,417
Then we can't notify
the police either, can we...

28
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:17,753
No, all I can do is pray that it's
returned to me without a scratch.

29
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:20,233
I understand.

30
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:24,135
Let us pray. I'm sure our
prayers will be answered.

31
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:33,158
And does she have any suspects?

32
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:37,826
Yes, the mirror could have only been
stolen by people in Mrs. Hazama's home.

33
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:44,674
She knows those two wanted it
and has no doubt they stole it.

34
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:48,856
She says they visited her the
other evening and after they left...

35
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:51,659
she noticed the mirror was gone.

36
00:02:52,268 --> 00:02:54,862
It was there when they arrived.

37
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:59,642
You'll need to find out where they've
hidden it before you can get it back.

38
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,878
I know what I have to do Seira.

39
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:05,281
Leave it to St. Tail.

40
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:09,994
It's done!
It's all done!!

41
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:14,600
Good Morning Miss Haneoka!
Beautiful morning, isn't it?!

42
00:03:15,147 --> 00:03:17,615
Oh, good morning Sawatari.

43
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:21,151
Oh, it's the latest school newspaper.

44
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:24,788
Look, the feature story is my scoop!

45
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:32,531
Mirror stolen from estate...
St. Tail is the thief?!

46
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:35,008
What's the matter, Haneoka?

47
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:36,345
Great, isn't it?

48
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,518
That's how I'll
strike a blow against St. Tail!

49
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:46,934
I've got more secret
information on this case, too!

50
00:03:50,284 --> 00:03:53,219
Hey, what's going on?!

51
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:56,953
What are you doing! Let me go!

52
00:03:56,998 --> 00:03:58,898
Hey, monkey boy!

53
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,469
Who are you calling a monkey?!

54
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,769
St. Tail would never do
anything like this and you know it!

55
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:09,479
You don't have any proof,
so don't print lies!

56
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:15,154
At any rate,
you'd better rewrite your story.

57
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:17,493
Th... they're right!

58
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:19,336
You wrote it without any proof...

59
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:22,539
so you're the one who's going to
look real bad in the end you know!

60
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:25,483
Why is she so upset?

61
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:29,357
Let me tell you something...

62
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:32,991
we reporters stake
our lives on our stories.

63
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:38,404
The universe could explode,
but we'd never rewrite our story!

64
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:41,982
He's hopeless.
I guess I have no other choice...

65
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,788
What the...?

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,663
"My target is Princess Rosa's mirror...?"

67
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,239
What the...?

68
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,507
A... a scoop!

69
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:56,775
Hey, give it back!

70
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:58,149
No way!

71
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:02,016
A note from St. Tail is a great scoop!

72
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:04,096
I've got to go rewrite my story!

73
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,263
Excuse me ladies! Adieu! Adios!

74
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:15,047
What was all that
about never rewriting a story?

75
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:16,584
But it worked out well.

76
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:21,891
Now he won't write about
the mirror belonging to Mrs. Hazama.

77
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:24,793
I think he knows more about the mirror.

78
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,236
I've got to find out.

79
00:05:29,683 --> 00:05:30,809
Journalism Club

80
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:39,429
Where'd Sawatari go off to anyway?
He's not here or in the classroom...

81
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:42,934
I've always been interested in journalism,
even when I was younger.

82
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,244
Really? You too, Miss Haneoka?

83
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:46,440
That's right!

84
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:49,111
Sawatari and Haneoka...?

85
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,227
I didn't know you were
interested in making the school paper.

86
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,669
Your constant enthusiasm
must have rubbed off on me.

87
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,710
Look around for as long as you like.

88
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:03,109
Girls are always welcome here.

89
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:04,477
Thank you.

90
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:09,724
Hey! Why am I hiding for?

91
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:12,231
Wow, is this your camera?

92
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,440
Did you take this photo
with this camera?

93
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:20,574
This is great!

94
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:22,449
There's a lot more! Want to see?

95
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:25,486
Yes! Wow!

96
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:28,890
You've even taken pictures of stars?
They're beautiful.

97
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:37,447
I feel like I'd be
intruding if I go in now.

98
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:39,177
But what I'm doing is eavesdropping...

99
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:43,316
I've put on a good act
pretending to be interested.

100
00:06:43,798 --> 00:06:45,629
Now all I have to
do is get the information.

101
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:49,401
By the way, about that mirror...

102
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:53,114
Haneoka!

103
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:55,981
What's with him?

104
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,488
I'm so happy!

105
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:58,989
Wait...

106
00:06:59,095 --> 00:07:05,125
Every girl who's come to me was
only interested in my good looks.

107
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:10,106
You're the first one who
showed an interest in my work!

108
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:12,011
You don't understand...

109
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:14,056
What am I gonna do?

110
00:07:14,593 --> 00:07:17,027
Haneoka, if it's alright, would you...

111
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,769
Asuka Jr.! Why is he here?

112
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:26,439
Monkey boy, I want to talk to you.

113
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:28,046
That's not my name!

114
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:30,146
Besides, I have nothing to say to you!

115
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:33,725
He couldn't be jealous?

116
00:07:36,235 --> 00:07:40,103
Sawatari, you know a lot more
about that mirror, don't you?

117
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:43,073
No, I guess not...

118
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:46,918
Reporters never reveal their sources.

119
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:51,417
The world could end,
but we'd never talk.

120
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:56,197
I'd like to hear more about it, too.
It must be a beautiful mirror.

121
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,941
It sure is!

122
00:07:58,113 --> 00:08:01,514
There's a story about a
princess in the mirror's history.

123
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:04,622
And it sure is interesting.

124
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,458
I thought you said you'd never talk,
not even if the world came to an end.

125
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,801
Alright already.
You want to hear it too, don't you?

126
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:14,967
Party pooper.

127
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:17,075
The legend behind this mirror...

128
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,712
is a love story about
Princess Rosa of Reyche.

129
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,920
A love story?

130
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:26,690
I did some research and
learned that a long time ago...

131
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:30,735
Princess Rosa fell in love with a
young mirror maker from her village.

132
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:36,842
She was sad because
she knew their love could never be.

133
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,358
Then one day...

134
00:08:38,593 --> 00:08:43,360
she asked him to make a mirror
that would reflect her true self.

135
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:45,365
Not the figure in royal robes.

136
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:50,205
And when the mirror was
finished and brought to the castle...

137
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:53,620
The woman reflected on
it was not Princess Rosa...

138
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,355
but a simple young maiden named Rosa,
her face filled with love.

139
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,659
The princess forsook her title...

140
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:02,328
and took only the mirror with her.

141
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,873
She left the castle
to marry the mirror maker.

142
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:06,412
And they lived happily ever after.

143
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:09,051
It has been said that any
woman possessing that mirror...

144
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:11,553
will live in happiness.

145
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:15,422
The real me...

146
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,105
A mirror that will reflect
the me that isn't St. Tail...

147
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,610
I guess that's why antique
collectors around the world...

148
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:31,455
especially women,
all want that mirror.

149
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:35,368
They can't even estimate
how much it will sell for.

150
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,512
And why would
St. Tail want that mirror?

151
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:43,819
As I suspected.
It's always about St. Tail.

152
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:46,492
That I don't know.

153
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:48,993
And this is top secret...

154
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:53,931
the mirror is being put
on the block at the city's auction.

155
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:55,771
What did you say?!

156
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,326
Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

157
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:09,428
One!

158
00:10:11,646 --> 00:10:12,738
Two!

159
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:17,016
Three!

160
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,624
I'm leaving now Ruby.

161
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:39,792
Seira, I want to ask you something.

162
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:43,603
Can you put a
stolen item up for auction?

163
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,713
Usually, no.

164
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,018
But the thieves also
took the appraisal slip with them.

165
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,022
So it's possible...

166
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:59,164
Take care of Ruby please.

167
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:00,408
I will.

168
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,641
May God bless and protect us.

169
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:38,415
This magnificent Evans violin...

170
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:43,220
has been sold for
20 million dollars to this gentleman.

171
00:11:55,587 --> 00:11:57,452
Hey you, don't get in the way.

172
00:11:57,657 --> 00:12:00,683
Tonight's the
night I capture St. Tail.

173
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:04,429
I gave you important information.

174
00:12:04,906 --> 00:12:09,002
The least you can do is
let me photograph the auction.

175
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:17,194
The next item...

176
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,495
is something we collectors have
been searching for for a long time.

177
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:22,638
And now we have it!

178
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,070
The famous Princess Rosa's Mirror!

179
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:38,663
Amazing!

180
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:41,570
So that's the famous
Princess Rosa's mirror!

181
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,005
It's fabulous!

182
00:12:49,294 --> 00:12:50,556
What's happening?

183
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:53,065
What happened to the lights?

184
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:54,694
What's going on here?

185
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:00,336
Wha...? A flower?

186
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:05,645
This flower is called...
The Princess Rosa!

187
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:07,524
It's Reyche's national flower!

188
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:09,063
They're lovely...

189
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:12,161
Oh, I get it!
It's part of the presentation!

190
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:13,697
This is great.

191
00:13:16,515 --> 00:13:17,743
The ceiling!

192
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:25,452
Wait! That mirror was stolen!

193
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,561
Who said that?

194
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:30,440
It couldn't be the Princess' ghost...

195
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:34,376
Please, everyone,
please remain calm.

196
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:37,910
Good evening.
Please forgive my intrusion.

197
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,991
Where?
Where's that voice coming from?

198
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:44,869
If I'd been on the stage...

199
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:47,635
she'd have been in my
blind spot and gotten away.

200
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,213
I was right about staying right here.

201
00:13:50,683 --> 00:13:54,779
Those two men stole that mirror.

202
00:13:55,226 --> 00:13:58,423
Stolen property... so you didn't...

203
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:00,796
Now!

204
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,470
I think we're in trouble!

205
00:14:06,882 --> 00:14:11,615
Now that you've been discovered,
why don't you be good and return it?

206
00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:15,895
Damn you!
We worked hard to get it!

207
00:14:17,972 --> 00:14:19,963
Alright, here's my chance!

208
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:23,376
I'm going to beat that St. Tail!

209
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,048
Damn!

210
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:39,034
It's Show Time!

211
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,022
It's too bright!

212
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,425
For you!

213
00:15:12,347 --> 00:15:13,279
Brother!

214
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:15,412
One!

215
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:17,015
Two!

216
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:18,915
Three!

217
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,171
St. Tail, where are you?

218
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:48,674
A reflection of one's true image...

219
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,258
The lights are back to normal!

220
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,997
Darn! The mirror's gone!

221
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:16,072
Hey, look on the stage!

222
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:16,971
What?

223
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:18,769
The thieves?!

224
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,962
"I have taken
Princess Rosa's mirror, St. Tail. "

225
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:33,706
Darn.

226
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:36,637
It was so bright,
I couldn't take any pictures.

227
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:39,017
What's gonna happen to my scoop?

228
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:41,378
It was never meant to
be printed in the first place.

229
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:42,351
What?

230
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,032
What was that back there I saw?

231
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:02,491
Lord, thank you for
returning my mirror.

232
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,594
"St. Tail returns priceless mirror.
Mirror taken from auction block. "

233
00:17:18,232 --> 00:17:19,426
What do you think?!

234
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:21,662
My scoop made the front page again.

235
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,634
He never gives up...

236
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:31,145
Good morning!

237
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,024
Good morning, Meimi.

238
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,051
Your hair looks nice today.

239
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:36,390
Really?

240
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:40,236
Maybe it does...

241
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:57,268
Were you at the auction last night?

242
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:08,495
I... um...

243
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:11,098
Did he catch on?

244
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,499
What do you mean?

245
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:19,516
It's me! I'm St. Tail...

246
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:26,864
Why?

247
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:33,471
Why are you asking me that?

248
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:38,086
As if I'd answer...

249
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:42,586
Oh, never mind.

250
00:18:44,938 --> 00:18:49,466
Besides, it's unscientific to see
someone else's reflection in a mirror.

251
00:18:53,187 --> 00:18:55,052
The lights blinded me for awhile...

252
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:57,055
maybe something happened to my eyes.

253
00:18:58,632 --> 00:19:00,031
I must have been seeing things.

254
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,573
But if I was hallucinating, then why?

255
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:14,621
Why was it that I saw...

256
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:16,923
Haneoka?
