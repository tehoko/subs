1
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:08,425
I heard that Graham's comet
will soon be visible!

2
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:10,435
What's that?

3
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,510
I know Halley's comet,
but not this one.

4
00:00:13,716 --> 00:00:18,483
It's the comet that passes
close to Earth every 50 years.

5
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:20,489
Wow.

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,965
I'm sure it's this Thursday
when it'll pass by Earth again.

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,670
How wonderful!
This Thursday, you say?

8
00:00:28,884 --> 00:00:31,910
How romantic!

9
00:00:34,596 --> 00:00:39,966
But you can't see it with the naked
eye. You have to go to an observatory.

10
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:44,840
What would happen
if a comet crashed into Earth?

11
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:47,578
I guess we'd all be blown to bits.

12
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:52,388
-Then what will you do, Ryoko?
-Get my important things and run!

13
00:00:52,603 --> 00:00:54,969
-To where?
-Your important things?

14
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:58,702
-Let me think...
-Important things, she says.

15
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:02,717
-My parents, for sure!
-Mine's my favorite fishing pole.

16
00:01:02,926 --> 00:01:07,295
My pillow! I can't sleep without it!

17
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:15,780
-You guys are a lost cause.
-What about you, Sawatari?

18
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:20,222
Let's run to the end of the world!

19
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:27,640
No way.

20
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:33,649
A COMET APPROACHES!
THE EARTH'S FINAL NIGHT??

21
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:35,552
You're all idiots!

22
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:40,669
A comet never leaves its orbit,
so it'll never crash into Earth.

23
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:44,574
I said "suppose"!
Don't call me an idiot, you idiot!

24
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:46,720
You want a fight?

25
00:01:46,924 --> 00:01:52,328
So that's it! You don't have anything
important to take, so you're mad.

26
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:56,563
What? You're wrong!
I do too have something precious!

27
00:01:57,146 --> 00:01:59,979
-Then tell us!
-You really want to know?

28
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:05,022
Are you two friends or enemies?
Make up your mind!

29
00:02:09,742 --> 00:02:13,735
-Who wants to be friends with him?
-Same here!

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,074

31
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:31,907
He didn't have time to tell me
what his important thing was.

32
00:02:32,626 --> 00:02:34,457
Make up my mind.

33
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:37,689
I'm not in love with her or anything.

34
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:41,373
I just don't know.

35
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,881
I'm home!

36
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:51,391
We must let the American people
know to prevent a tragedy!

37
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:54,832
But that will only cause a panic.

38
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:58,808
-You're saying to keep quiet?
-We only have a few minutes.

39
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:00,808
I'm home.

40
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,252
Oh, welcome home.

41
00:03:04,597 --> 00:03:05,962
It's too late!

42
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:08,897
It's too soon to give up.

43
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:13,304
-Mom, where's my snack?
-There should be something.

44
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:15,212
Nope!

45
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:21,018
Gosh! What are they watching anyway,
all cuddled up during the day?

46
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,472
COMET COLLIDES!
THE LAST NIGHT ON EARTH: 1953 USA

47
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,048
It brings back memories.

48
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:48,916
It sure did. This was the movie
we saw on our first date.

49
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,890
Genichiro.

50
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:54,895
Eimi.

51
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:02,886
I guess I'll go change.

52
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:06,855
This is so embarrassing.

53
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:14,847
Sorry I'm late!

54
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,352
What is it this time?

55
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:23,295
Well, it's an incident that
occurred about an hour ago.

56
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,768
I'm first!

57
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:29,709
Ouch! You mustn't run around here.

58
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:32,221
I'm sorry, Sister.

59
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:37,262
You're in the choir, aren't you?
What's the big hurry?

60
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,698
Truth is...

61
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,149
Graham's comet?

62
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:48,453
That's right, Sister.
We have to see that comet!

63
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:50,788
Akio's going to move away soon.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,130
That's why we all decided
to go see the comet.

65
00:04:55,343 --> 00:04:58,710
-You can't see it with your naked eye.
-I know.

66
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:04,878
So I went to the observatory and asked
if we could use the telescope.

67
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:07,794
At first they agreed, but then...

68
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,269
No one's told me anything about that.

69
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:16,379
But I talked to
the director last week!

70
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,493
Last week? That director was
transferred to another observatory.

71
00:05:21,902 --> 00:05:22,891
What?

72
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,007
Then let us talk to the new director!

73
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:30,473
He's a busy man.
You're disrupting our work. Go home!

74
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,483
-Oh, my.
-It's not fair.

75
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:38,426
We were looking forward to it.
So we came to pray for God's help.

76
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,164
So we can get to see the comet!

77
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:49,524
Isn't there some other way, Seira?

78
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:54,429
You can only see it with an
observatory's astronomical telescope.

79
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,934
Of course.

80
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,139
Okay! Let St. Tail handle this.

81
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:11,134
It looks like that Sawatari's
really serious about Meimi.

82
00:06:11,345 --> 00:06:16,510
I wonder what got into him. He was
never interested in girls before.

83
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:20,523
-What do you think, Asuka?
-How would I know?

84
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:22,927
What a grouch!

85
00:06:23,138 --> 00:06:26,107
-Who cares?
-Hey! The enemy is approaching!

86
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:29,106
Prepare to fire!

87
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:32,584
What--?

88
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,591
What is this?!

89
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:46,748
Rotten kids! How dare you
attack an innocent passerby?

90
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:52,197
Adults are all liars!

91
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:03,250
Hey, Asuka, looking good.

92
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:05,895
You can't hit me!

93
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:09,234
Great strategy!

94
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:17,213
"Dear Mr. Detective:

95
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:22,955
I will steal Graham's comet
this coming Thursday. -St. Tail"

96
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:26,436
-It's a challenge!
-A challenge?

97
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,342
Wow! Let me see!

98
00:07:29,553 --> 00:07:31,987
How's she gonna steal a comet?

99
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:36,458
There's no way...
So that's it!

100
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:40,866
She's gonna steal
the observatory's telescope!

101
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:44,844
That's the only way to see
the comet around here!

102
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,659
My theory's definitely right.

103
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:53,130
Never mind.
You're dripping all over the place.

104
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:57,673
-But stealing it won't be easy.
-I also agree.

105
00:07:57,882 --> 00:07:59,349
Did you hear that?

106
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:04,220
She'll think of a way!
I'll be ready for you, St. Tail!

107
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,422
How can he be so sure
based on no facts?

108
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:11,164
I don't know.
It must be love, love.

109
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:18,383
It's a perfect night to present
the comet to the children.

110
00:08:18,595 --> 00:08:21,758
Ruby, take care of things here.

111
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,777
No, Ruby! I have work to do!

112
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:34,051
Oh, all right. Will you help me?

113
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:38,229
Okay. But just this one time.

114
00:08:41,713 --> 00:08:45,479
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

115
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:52,261
One!

116
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:55,802
Two!

117
00:08:57,347 --> 00:09:00,214
Three!

118
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:21,458
Meimi, hurry! Everyone will be
here soon for choir practice.

119
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,401
I know. You and Ruby take care
of the other things.

120
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:29,306
The children will be happy for sure!

121
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,651
You can count on me!

122
00:09:33,996 --> 00:09:37,625
May the blessings of God be with us.

123
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:16,210
Wow. This certainly is
a magnificent telescope.

124
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:22,662
Asuka Jr.!

125
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:26,637
But why does she want a telescope?

126
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:32,650
-It will go smoothly tonight.
-Especially without those pesky kids!

127
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:37,228
We can't let those kids ruin
such a great astronomical event.

128
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:42,101
-How's it going?
-Everything's going smoothly, sir.

129
00:10:42,314 --> 00:10:43,440
Is that so?

130
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:48,588
Asuka Jr., is St. Tail really
coming to steal this telescope?

131
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:50,589
I'm certain of it.

132
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:55,037
You've got the right idea
except for the last detail.

133
00:10:55,243 --> 00:10:58,610
We'll leave you
to take care of St. Tail.

134
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:02,015
We don't want our research
hampered by a thief.

135
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:04,150
Of all the nerve!

136
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:09,164
The comet passes once every 50 years.
It's just as important to children.

137
00:11:09,374 --> 00:11:13,970
They want to keep it for themselves.
God will never forgive this!

138
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:16,113
One!

139
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,954
Two!

140
00:11:19,163 --> 00:11:21,063
Three!

141
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:29,842
-Where did they come from?
-Who did this?

142
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:32,385
Stop this!

143
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:36,653
-No, stop!
-I was wrong!

144
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,740
I know it's you, St. Tail!

145
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:49,280
How's she gonna steal
this huge thing anyway?

146
00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:04,025
Well, that's all for today.

147
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:09,690
And now, I have some sad news
for all of you today.

148
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:13,078
Today is Akio's last practice...

149
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:17,083
...since he will be leaving soon.

150
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:23,699
-Take care.
-Thanks.

151
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,435
Too bad we couldn't see the comet.

152
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,775
-It can't be helped.
-See you!

153
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:34,924
Akio, I hope you never lose
your bright outlook on life.

154
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:39,200
-I won't! Goodbye, Mother Superior!
-Goodbye!

155
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:48,186
-Mother Superior, where is Seira?
-She's not out here.

156
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,807
Oh, but I am outside.

157
00:12:58,851 --> 00:13:01,843
Though this is a little embarrassing.

158
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:09,328
Hello, children! These balloons
are for you from the snowman!

159
00:13:11,913 --> 00:13:17,215
-This is a reward for being so good.
-Gee, thanks, Mr. Snowman!

160
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:21,694
There's one for everyone.
Here you go.

161
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,631
Wow! A snowman!

162
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:28,136
Here you go!

163
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,147
Thank you!

164
00:13:38,606 --> 00:13:43,043
Hey, Akio. There's something
on your balloon.

165
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:50,489
Come to the observatory.
I'll give you Graham's comet.

166
00:13:51,836 --> 00:13:54,930
-Let's go!
-Where are you kids going?

167
00:13:55,243 --> 00:13:57,438
We'll be right back, Mommy!

168
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:04,418
-What's this?
-Get down here, St. Tail!

169
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:07,392
If you don't, I'm going up there!

170
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:12,868
I'll get you for sure today
and unmask you!

171
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:22,095
It's...

172
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:26,107
...show...

173
00:14:26,914 --> 00:14:29,178
...time!

174
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:40,868
Sir! This is terrible!

175
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:44,539
-Look at the monitor!
-What is it?

176
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:48,123
A part of the comet has broken off...

177
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:51,058
...and is falling towards us
at great speed!

178
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:53,668
That's ridiculous! Let me see!

179
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:59,408
-Why didn't you see this before?
-I don't know.

180
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:04,851
A part of the comet. That's
something like a meteor, isn't it?

181
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:06,760
No, very far from it!

182
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:11,133
It could make a huge hole!
We may not be safe here!

183
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:15,806
-Let's get away!
-Wait for me! Come back here!

184
00:15:16,056 --> 00:15:19,048
Everyone's gone finally!
Now's my chance!

185
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:22,528
Hey, you! Don't you move from there!

186
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:30,439
Why aren't you running away?
A part of the comet is heading here!

187
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:32,588
So what?

188
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:36,423
So what? What could you
be thinking about?

189
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,802
I'm gonna arrest you!

190
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:47,319
My legs, I can't move them.

191
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,324
Is there another reason?

192
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:54,297
Like what if you died, what's
the most important thing you'd take?

193
00:15:54,508 --> 00:15:56,339
Something important?

194
00:15:56,546 --> 00:15:59,344
-Yes. Do you have something?
-No!

195
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:03,319
I can't think of anything
until I arrest you!

196
00:16:20,065 --> 00:16:23,432
Meimi, no! Get ahold of yourself!

197
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:35,797
I'm sorry. It was an act.

198
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:41,271
Nothing's falling to Earth.
I rigged the whole thing.

199
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:43,279
You what?

200
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:46,782
One! Two! Three!

201
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:56,239
COMET COLLIDES! THE LAST NIGHT
ON EARTH; THE END

202
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:58,344
What?

203
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:15,078
Hey! Why did you do this?

204
00:17:16,391 --> 00:17:20,452
Don't worry. I've recorded
the correct data too.

205
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:24,569
And could you let in
the children waiting outside?

206
00:17:24,942 --> 00:17:26,705
Outside?

207
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:29,580
Rats!

208
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:31,812
Come back here!

209
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:37,056
Boy, that was close!

210
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,034
But he wouldn't have said it
like that...

211
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:43,269
...if he knew I was Meimi.
I'm sure of it.

212
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:52,724
The children waiting outside?

213
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,993
What's going on?

214
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:15,952
Wow, there it is! I see it!

215
00:18:16,157 --> 00:18:18,455
-The comet!
-It really has a tail!

216
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:20,595
Yeah, this is great!

217
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,197
-I wonder when we'll see it again?
-In 50 years.

218
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:29,576
Then let's all come here
again to look at it!

219
00:18:29,787 --> 00:18:30,811
Yeah!

220
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:34,015
I just don't get it.

221
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,690
Why did St. Tail--?
Hey, what's this all about?

222
00:18:38,907 --> 00:18:42,570
Thank you, sir.
We all prayed to God.

223
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:46,411
We asked Him to let us see the comet.

224
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:50,989
Thank you, God!

225
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:53,627
God.

226
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:59,675
Look, falling stars!

227
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:07,025
Did you ask God for something?

228
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,134
-No.
-Why not?

229
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:13,846
Because my wish...

230
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,885
...is for God.

231
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:23,848
