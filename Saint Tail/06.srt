1
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,331
"Cherry blossom"?

2
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,149
We learned it in
English class, Meimi.

3
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:18,318
It's the English
words for "Sakura".

4
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:20,885
Oh, is it?

5
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:23,795
There's a painting
called "Cherry Blossom"...

6
00:00:23,873 --> 00:00:25,363
at the Central Museum.

7
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:27,172
Oh, I know about that painting.

8
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:31,975
Isn't that the masterpiece
so admired...

9
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:34,789
for it's life-like
withering petals?

10
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:38,035
I'd like to see it once myself.

11
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:41,509
You're going to steal the painting.

12
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:43,412
Rather, I'd like you to get it back.

13
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:44,818
Get it back?

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,726
An old man came to me
for help yesterday.

15
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:58,309
He says that the owner
of the museum deceived him.

16
00:00:58,422 --> 00:00:59,912
Meaning?

17
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,127
The old man thought
he signed a contract...

18
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,465
to loan "Cherry Blossom"
to the museum.

19
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:10,066
Later he found out they had
switched the contract to one...

20
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,744
that transferred ownership
of the painting.

21
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:18,354
What is that?! How mean!

22
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:23,936
The modern art exhibition
has just opened.

23
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:25,715
So during the...

24
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:27,252
I get the idea, Seira.

25
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,457
Just leave the rest to St. Tail!

26
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:36,469
New Student Rina.
A Formidable Enemy

27
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:44,621
Darn!

28
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,395
I still can't beat this game!

29
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,266
Me neither.

30
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:50,399
And I've used up
this month's allowance.

31
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:52,575
Hey, where's Asuka?

32
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,947
Over there.

33
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,615
He's been like that the whole time.

34
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,807
Take that!

35
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:07,578
Hey, I think you
should retreat a bit.

36
00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:08,644
Huh?

37
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,226
That's from you butting in!

38
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:16,501
No, dodge those!
And those, too!

39
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:17,440
And those, too!

40
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,706
Too slow!

41
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:20,645
Now, punch!
No, dodge again!

42
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:21,812
What are you doing?!
Kick! Kick!

43
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:23,117
Jump! Jump!

44
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:24,659
Go now! Do it! Do...!

45
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:25,923
Shut up!!

46
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:29,392
Quit your yakking!

47
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:34,414
You're so frustrating.
Here, let me!

48
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,681
What do you think you're doing?!

49
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:42,702
You...

50
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,631
Bad form.

51
00:02:44,677 --> 00:02:46,440
Whose fault is that, huh?!!

52
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:48,643
Just who the heck are you anyway?!

53
00:02:48,686 --> 00:02:50,551
Butting into other people's business!

54
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,425
Your interference ruined my game!

55
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:58,196
Hey, are you listening?!

56
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:00,541
Hold on, what's that?

57
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:01,580
Huh?

58
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,587
"I'm going to the Central Museum
tomorrow night...

59
00:03:05,627 --> 00:03:07,356
to get Cherry Blossom".

60
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:10,166
This is...?

61
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,072
It's a warning from St. Tail!

62
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:16,578
St. Tail?

63
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:17,517
Who's that?

64
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:18,488
Ah?

65
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:21,992
You're living in this town
and you don't know St. Tail?

66
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,431
What's wrong with you?

67
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:28,097
How rude! I just moved here!

68
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:30,841
Hey, she's...

69
00:03:31,622 --> 00:03:33,453
taller than me...

70
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,990
and I don't have time.

71
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:38,523
-I have to think up a strategy!
-Hey, wait...!

72
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:40,638
Wait up!

73
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,908
St. Tail, I'll get you
for sure this time!

74
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:46,546
Hey, hold on!

75
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:47,680
Huh?

76
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:51,356
Sheesh, I 'm busy!

77
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:55,668
-I said hold on!
-You 're annoying me!

78
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:01,587
Darn it!

79
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,509
You 're not very fit, are you?

80
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:14,749
Shut up.

81
00:04:14,926 --> 00:04:18,293
Hey, tell me about St. Tail.

82
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:20,197
No way.

83
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:23,899
Hey, what are you doing?!
Cut it out!

84
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,608
So, you gonna tell me now?!

85
00:04:26,687 --> 00:04:28,086
Forget it.

86
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:31,491
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

87
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:33,693
Okay, I'll tell you!
Let go of me!

88
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,674
Ooh, that hurt.
I thought I was gonna die.

89
00:04:37,714 --> 00:04:39,579
I'm sorry, did that really hurt?

90
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:40,812
Of course!

91
00:04:40,888 --> 00:04:41,786
And...

92
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:45,127
St. Tail is a girl thief.

93
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,761
Oh, a thief.

94
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:50,065
That means she's a bad guy.

95
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:51,111
What else?

96
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:55,582
Her true identity is unknown. But she's
so sly, that the police can't catch her.

97
00:04:55,657 --> 00:04:57,989
The police can't catch her?!

98
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:03,100
I've made up my mind.

99
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:05,575
Where's the Central Museum?

100
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,481
At Third Ave and Bay Street, but...

101
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:12,185
OK, thanks.

102
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:13,924
Sorry if I was
a bit rough on you.

103
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:17,467
I'm Rina Takamiya.
I'm 14 years old.

104
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:18,634
See you!

105
00:05:20,316 --> 00:05:21,977
What's with her?

106
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,386
Time to eat, Meimi!

107
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:26,653
Alright!

108
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,096
Wow, it looks delicious.

109
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,235
Don't!

110
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:33,334
Really!

111
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:35,077
Now call Papa.

112
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:36,182
Okay.

113
00:05:42,804 --> 00:05:44,237
You scared me!

114
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:45,633
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,643
What am I gonna do with you?

116
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,974
What are you doing, Papa?

117
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:51,555
Hmm? This.

118
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,822
Those are Tarot cards, aren't they?

119
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,692
Yeah.

120
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:58,196
I'm wondering if I can use tarot card
fortune-telling to do some new magic.

121
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:02,173
That sounds like fun!
Will you try it on me?

122
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,844
Sure.

123
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:22,161
What's wrong, Papa?

124
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:25,764
Is anything wrong with that card?

125
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,312
Mama, don't scare us like that!

126
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:33,388
Really, Meimi!

127
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,490
You should keep your mind
on the task at hand.

128
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:38,093
It's time for dinner, both of you.

129
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:39,534
Alright.

130
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:43,069
What's so funny, dear?

131
00:06:43,181 --> 00:06:44,011
Nothing.

132
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:46,607
It's just that you and Meimi
do the things the same way.

133
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,384
What?

134
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,758
I'm a little worried
about Meimi, though.

135
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:52,628
What's the matter?

136
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:56,874
According to the cards,
she's in for a bit of an ordeal.

137
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:58,841
Oh?

138
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:04,382
She'll be all right, because like me,
her best feature is her cheerfulness.

139
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,891
That's true.

140
00:07:06,003 --> 00:07:09,097
And besides, my bad fortune-telling
is probably wrong.

141
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:12,370
Well, well, what's
for dinner tonight?

142
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,283
Today it's your favorite, beef stew.

143
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,691
That sounds great!

144
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:20,631
Papa, Mama, I'm gonna start eating!

145
00:07:20,704 --> 00:07:21,693
Hey!

146
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:26,747
Oh, I'm full.

147
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:34,063
Come on, Ruby.

148
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:39,533
I can't today, I've got work to do.

149
00:07:40,518 --> 00:07:41,576
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,259
OK!

151
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:52,007
Oh, I forgot to ask Papa
about the tarot cards.

152
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:53,841
Oh well.

153
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:55,882
I'll just give it
my all today!

154
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,269
Forgive me, for I use
no gimmick or trick.

155
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:11,491
One...

156
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,064
Two...

157
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:18,841
Three!

158
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:38,209
May the blessings
of God be with us.

159
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,223
It's gonna be great today!

160
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,602
Meimi, be careful tonight.

161
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:46,570
Why?

162
00:08:46,644 --> 00:08:48,805
I feel strangely uneasy.

163
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:53,116
You mean Asuka Jr.?
He's nothing to worry about.

164
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,560
Not Asuka Jr., something else.
Something else is going to happen.

165
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:02,773
Don't worry!

166
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,280
So long as the blessings of God
are with us...

167
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:08,121
there's nothing
St. Tail can't do!

168
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:10,053
Well, I better go.

169
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:34,222
Asuka Jr.

170
00:09:35,628 --> 00:09:37,459
Everyone is in position.

171
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,491
All right, good work.

172
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:43,436
If you see someone suspicious,
don't let him get away, understand?

173
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:44,411
We found this one loitering.

174
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:45,278
Whaa?!

175
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,179
Come along!

176
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,484
All right, I'm coming,
you don't have to pull me like that.

177
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:50,116
Now what?

178
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,758
Hey, it's you!

179
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:53,894
It's you...

180
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:56,967
What are you doing here?

181
00:09:57,246 --> 00:10:01,580
You're in charge of security?
Wow, you're only in grade school.

182
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:04,625
I'm in Junior High and
I'm the same age as you!

183
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:05,698
Oh, really?

184
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:08,059
She insists that she's
authorized personnel...

185
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:10,131
and refuses to move
from the entrance.

186
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:12,810
Asuka Jr., this one is a girl.

187
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:15,985
Maybe she's St. Tail?

188
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,290
Take your filthy hands off me!

189
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:28,376
I'm going to stand
guard over here, too.

190
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:29,418
Hold on!

191
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:34,858
I was appointed by the Mayor
to investigate St. Tail!

192
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:37,704
You can't go around doing whatever
you want without my permission!

193
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:39,405
The Mayor?

194
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,576
Yes!

195
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:44,613
The Mayor happens to be my Uncle.

196
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,359
Which makes you the Mayor's niece?

197
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:52,233
Yes! Besides, we've got a lot
of our paintings here, too!

198
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:54,106
We can't have a thief breaking in!

199
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:55,416
But... but...

200
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,812
Well, you go ahead and
do what you have to do.

201
00:10:59,896 --> 00:11:01,386
Darn it.

202
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,638
Asuka Jr.

203
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:06,999
Get off me!

204
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,253
"Cherry Blossom"

205
00:11:25,992 --> 00:11:28,256
It's splendid, just as they say.

206
00:11:33,677 --> 00:11:36,612
Hey, cut it out!
That's so annoying!

207
00:11:37,486 --> 00:11:38,976
You know, it's all because of you!

208
00:11:39,892 --> 00:11:41,120
What's up?

209
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:43,987
It's St. Tail.
Don't move!

210
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:45,263
Asuka Jr.!

211
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,670
Don't panic! Switch on
the emergency lights!

212
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:52,917
All right! Everyone, check
up on your assigned posts!

213
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:54,747
What's wrong?

214
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:56,489
Cherry Blossom is gone!

215
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:58,030
It can't be!

216
00:12:00,942 --> 00:12:01,806
Darn it!

217
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:07,882
This is a cherry blossom petal.

218
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:09,425
There are more
trailing off that way!

219
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:15,435
If we follow the trail,
we' ll run into the thief!

220
00:12:15,978 --> 00:12:18,071
Hold it!
Don't go acting on your own!

221
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,644
Why don't you stay here, then?

222
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:25,792
I have confidence in my legs and my
strength, so I'll go nab the thief!

223
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:27,939
Hey!

224
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:33,470
Oh shoot! That's her way of
throwing us into confusion.

225
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,543
Hey, maybe that girl has
already caught St. Tail.

226
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:49,585
Could be. That would really
make us look like fools.

227
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:53,288
All right! We'll follow the
cherry blossom petals! Follow me!

228
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:54,096
Yes, sir!

229
00:12:54,604 --> 00:12:57,698
Darn it, I'm the one who's
going to capture St. Tail!

230
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:04,182
Hmm... pretty good...

231
00:13:04,996 --> 00:13:07,226
but not clever enough.

232
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:11,840
I wonder who that girl is?

233
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:18,611
Here I have with me a piece of cloth.
Nothing up my sleeve.

234
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:24,466
The masterpiece, Cherry Blossom,
that disappeared...

235
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:25,510
Appear!

236
00:13:33,498 --> 00:13:34,396
Ta-da!

237
00:13:36,438 --> 00:13:39,430
As a matter of fact,
I didn 't steal it, yet!

238
00:13:40,815 --> 00:13:42,908
I'm not letting you
get away, St. Tail!

239
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,749
So, that's the room!

240
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:59,114
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
I'm the one who's capturing St. Tail!

241
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:02,824
"Please keep the supply closet clean."

242
00:14:04,705 --> 00:14:06,696
Hey, what are you doing?

243
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:09,377
And just why are you here?

244
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:13,084
I couldn't help it.
The petals led me here!

245
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:15,827
This is St. Tail's usual
way of confusing people!

246
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:18,867
Which means you fell for
the same trick every time?

247
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,807
There are more petals.
Let's go!

248
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:25,917
Wait for me!

249
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:31,627
Hey! Isn't this her usual trick?

250
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,398
Shut up!

251
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,963
You are just worried about
your paintings, aren't you?

252
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:36,637
That's all you're worried about!

253
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:38,080
What? You actually
believed me?

254
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:38,982
What?

255
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:41,655
What I told you were, obviously,
all lies.

256
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:43,223
What?!

257
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:51,807
They say that lying makes a thief!
Even a thief possesses an ounce of logic!

258
00:14:52,453 --> 00:14:57,117
This is absurd!
Don 't you forget it!
In other words, you're pretty bad
at avoiding and dodging things.

259
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:04,039
What's this?
We're outside.

260
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,405
There's something strange going on.

261
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:09,311
Although it's not the right season,
the cherry blossom is in full bloom.

262
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:11,121
What's going on?

263
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:12,600
Asuka Jr.!

264
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:15,671
Up there, on top of that thing!

265
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,042
St. Tail!

266
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:23,950
St. Tail? That's her?

267
00:15:24,397 --> 00:15:28,026
Good work. I'm taking
Cherry Blossom with me.

268
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:29,397
Just a minute!

269
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:30,465
Hey, hold it!

270
00:15:31,313 --> 00:15:37,877
When I grow up, I'll become a police
officer. And I'll arrest St. Tail!

271
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,324
No way! If anyone arrests St. Tail,
it'll be me!

272
00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:43,837
It really doesn't matter
who arrests her, does it!?

273
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,705
Be quiet!

274
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:45,541
Nyaaah!

275
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:49,116
I know it's not the right season,
but I'll give you two a free show...

276
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:50,986
of falling cherry blossom petals!

277
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:56,759
It's Show Time!

278
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:10,468
Thank you.

279
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:28,774
Hold it!

280
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:31,348
Ouch...

281
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,523
Hey! Let go of me!

282
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:36,023
What? Oh, sorry.

283
00:16:38,407 --> 00:16:39,704
She's outwitted me again.

284
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:46,713
Humph! She may be a thief,
but she's just a girl!

285
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:50,525
If only you didn't get in my way,
I would have captured her!

286
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,438
You really are so...!

287
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,344
Thank you!

288
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:40,709
Good morning, Meimi.
You're going to be late.

289
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:43,015
Oh, good morning, Kyoko.

290
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:48,358
Seira... nothing happened yesterday.

291
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,390
Miss Haneoka!

292
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:03,430
Oh, good morning, Sister.

293
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:06,747
Good morning, Miss Haneoka.
I'd like you to do me a favor.

294
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:10,586
This is a new student who will be in
your class. Please take her with you.

295
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:12,252
Sure, I'd be glad to.

296
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,657
Miss Takamiya!

297
00:18:13,702 --> 00:18:15,602
"ST. TAIL EXPOSES MUSEUM SWINDLE
Owner Arrested"

298
00:18:18,982 --> 00:18:19,778
What!?

299
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:24,286
This is Rina Takamiya, a new
student who has just arrived today.

300
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:25,428
Nice to meet you.

301
00:18:26,132 --> 00:18:28,123
She's... yesterday's...

302
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:30,164
Just a minute!

303
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,343
I'll become a police officer...!

304
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:40,589
Please take care of her,
Miss Haneoka.

305
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:42,167
Uh... yes!

306
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:49,508
You keep staring at me.
Is there something on my face?

307
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:54,215
No. I'm Meimi Haneoka,
glad to meet you.

308
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,864
If you ever need anything,
just ask me.

309
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,205
-Okay. I do have one question.
Huh?

310
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:02,879
There's this boy I'd like
to meet, named Asuka Jr..

311
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:04,620
Is he at this school?
