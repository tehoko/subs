1
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,255
A fake warning letter?

2
00:00:09,794 --> 00:00:10,818
What's going on?

3
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:13,424
Wasn't it St. Tail
who stole the swan?!

4
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:16,469
That means the one
I caught was the real St. Tail?

5
00:00:20,984 --> 00:00:22,815
Great! My hands
are getting numb...!

6
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:32,704
SAKURAOKA

7
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:43,320
THE MAYOR'S AMBITION!
STEALING A SWAN (PART 2)

8
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:58,625
Asuka Jr.! You're safe!

9
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:09,572
I'm sorry. I not only
let St. Tail get away...

10
00:01:09,684 --> 00:01:10,673
...but the swan was stolen, too...

11
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,811
I heard all of
the security guards...

12
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:14,552
...were given knockout drops.

13
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:15,696
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:16,131 --> 00:01:17,223
Asuka.

15
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:19,393
I'm wondering...

16
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,837
...if you are really serious
about catching St. Tail.

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,905
Someone
mentioned that to me.

18
00:01:30,628 --> 00:01:32,858
No way! I'm...!

19
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:36,762
Either way, if the swan
doesn't come back...

20
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:40,006
...I have no choice
but to resign as mayor.

21
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:42,546
Naturally, your assignment...

22
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:44,621
...to catch St. Tail
will be terminated, too.

23
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:47,160
No way...!

24
00:01:47,797 --> 00:01:48,764
Let's go back.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,913
Then who is
going to catch her?

26
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:01,214
Someone else...

27
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,153
Someone else and not me...?!

28
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:05,153
I couldn't stand that!

29
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:07,265
PIease wait, Mr. Mayor!

30
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:13,549
"Tomorrow night...

31
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,808
...I'm going
to the Okajima residence...

32
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,079
...the mayor of Sakuraoka...

33
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:18,019
...in order to pick
up the "Swan."

34
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,286
-St. Tail"

35
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:21,064
This is...!

36
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,565
SAKURAOKA

37
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:25,801
If Okajima's license plate...

38
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:27,433
...and that car's license
plate are the same...

39
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:30,238
...this is a real warning note.

40
00:02:31,687 --> 00:02:34,815
What should I do?
Should I leave it to the police?

41
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,696
What on earth is St. Tail
going to do with the swan?

42
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:41,134
What should I do...?!

43
00:02:49,024 --> 00:02:50,821
That's all right, Meimi.

44
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:52,860
If the swan is returned...

45
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:55,558
...Asuka Jr. won't
be fired, will he?

46
00:02:56,305 --> 00:02:58,603
I... I don't care about him!

47
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:01,877
I'm thinking about the people
who came for help...!

48
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:07,746
Why did you go to the trouble
of giving him a warning note?

49
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:11,926
Because I promised it,
and he was depressed...!

50
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:15,770
It seems to me
you are Iooking forward...

51
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:19,707
...to seeing him as St. Tail.

52
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:21,121
Am I wrong?

53
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,393
Anyway, the important thing now
is to get the swan back!

54
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,211
She isn't wrong...

55
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,318
I wanted to see...

56
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:46,104
...the eyes which
stare only at me...

57
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,030
I wanted to see him...

58
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,572
That's why I sent him
the warning notes.

59
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:22,539
I'll definitely get
the swan back. Defiinitely!

60
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:42,478
Man! This wall is awfully high!

61
00:04:43,393 --> 00:04:45,725
That's why
the rich people are...!

62
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:50,495
Who's there?!

63
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,970
Have I been spotted?!

64
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,568
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

65
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:12,919
One!

66
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:16,626
Two!

67
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:21,363
Three!

68
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,566
May the blessings
of God be with us.

69
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:42,539
And with Asuka Jr., too.

70
00:05:43,484 --> 00:05:44,451
Seira...

71
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:46,814
Thank you...

72
00:05:57,446 --> 00:05:59,710
It went better than I thought.

73
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:01,845
Mr. Okajima.

74
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:06,491
Don't relax until we take
the swan outside tonight.

75
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:08,868
You're right.

76
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:17,978
They must be
Okajima and Yabe...

77
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:19,782
I wonder where the swan is...

78
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:22,596
Sir!

79
00:06:22,832 --> 00:06:23,799
Who's this?

80
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:27,600
This guy was trying
to sneak in here.

81
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,904
Oh, he really did it...!

82
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,988
What should we do with him?
Call the police?

83
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:42,063
The police aren't a good idea.

84
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:45,003
I have something to do now.

85
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:46,635
Until I can give
you instructions...

86
00:06:46,748 --> 00:06:47,874
...lock him up somewhere.

87
00:06:48,385 --> 00:06:49,352
What...?

88
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:50,855
I understand.

89
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,957
Come on!

90
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:53,890
What are you doing?!
Let me go!

91
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:56,723
Asuka Jr. ...

92
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:01,571
How do you do?

93
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,681
Are you,
by any chance, St. Tail?

94
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:10,022
If you are, that boy
is your friend, isn't he?

95
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,356
Oh, shoot!
I was careless...

96
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,161
...because I was
distracted by Asuka Jr. ...

97
00:07:30,438 --> 00:07:31,405
It's no use...

98
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,608
There's no way out of here.

99
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,785
Why on earth did I come here?

100
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:43,664
I'm pitiful!

101
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:48,500
I'm the one
who will catch St. Tail!

102
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,378
No matter what,
I have to get the swan back!

103
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:53,451
This way!

104
00:07:57,628 --> 00:08:01,530
As you can see,
your friend is safe, Ms. St. Tail.

105
00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:04,705
We've been hospitable,
haven't we?

106
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:09,249
Keep quiet for a while.

107
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,628
It can't be true!

108
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:38,979
In this darkness...

109
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:40,944
...I'm sure
he can't see my face...

110
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,189
Good evening!

111
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:46,694
Hey...!

112
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:48,757
What shall I do?

113
00:08:54,345 --> 00:08:55,744
- Excuse me!
- Yes!

114
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:58,714
Is it true that
the warning message...

115
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,484
...in the newspaper was fake?

116
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:04,855
Did that man do it?

117
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,205
Please tell me
what's going on with this case.

118
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:13,182
Otherwise...

119
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,254
...I can't catch you...!

120
00:09:49,225 --> 00:09:50,192
I see.

121
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:54,256
So they're taking it
out of the country tonight...

122
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,065
Why are you...

123
00:09:58,511 --> 00:10:00,843
...going to such lengths
to get the swan back?

124
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,285
Why are you?

125
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,857
Oh, shoot!
If the case wasn't like this...

126
00:10:23,262 --> 00:10:25,025
...I could have arrested you.

127
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:32,173
Why don't we
cooperate with each other...

128
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,976
...just this once
until we get the swan back?

129
00:10:37,926 --> 00:10:38,893
All right!

130
00:10:43,905 --> 00:10:45,532
Now that we've decided,
just step back.

131
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,542
I'll be a decoy,
and you can find the swan.

132
00:10:56,331 --> 00:10:57,298
One!

133
00:10:58,201 --> 00:10:59,190
Two!

134
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:00,834
Three!

135
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,276
Watch out!
We're on the second floor!

136
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:13,724
He fell...!

137
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:16,396
I heard something.

138
00:11:17,174 --> 00:11:18,141
What's that?!

139
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:19,368
Chase her! Don't let her go!

140
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:27,318
If she could escape
from the room so easily...

141
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:28,861
...why didn't she tell me...?

142
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:31,096
We'll be late
for the boat's departure.

143
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:33,839
Don't worry
about the intruders, Yabe!

144
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:35,335
Bring it quickly!

145
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:41,923
Is that the swan?

146
00:11:43,228 --> 00:11:44,195
Hurry up!

147
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,813
The back door isn't shut.

148
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:58,350
What? That's strange...

149
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:21,036
Asuka Jr. got in the car...?

150
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,998
That means the swan is...?!

151
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,099
I have to chase them!

152
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:57,304
Here it is! The swan!

153
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,446
But I can't jump out with this.

154
00:13:28,746 --> 00:13:30,475
Why are you here?!

155
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,487
Don't give me any trouble.
Hand it over.

156
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:40,231
No! I won't give it to you
even if you have to kill me!

157
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:27,830
God knows all your evil actions!

158
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,701
Return the swan!

159
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:33,670
Hey! Don't you care
about what happens to him?

160
00:14:52,887 --> 00:14:53,945
It's...

161
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:58,361
...Show...

162
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,231
...Time!

163
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:08,016
My eyes...!

164
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:12,024
Grab hold of me!

165
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,030
I won't let go of you!

166
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,166
You...!

167
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,964
I didn't feel a thing...!

168
00:15:41,621 --> 00:15:43,646
Let us down!

169
00:15:43,758 --> 00:15:46,226
Hey! Return the swan!

170
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:49,732
Swans fly away in the spring.

171
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:28,575
You promised me
you wouldn't arrest me.

172
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:41,575
But only this once!

173
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:44,641
The next time we meet,
I definitely will...!

174
00:16:45,686 --> 00:16:49,349
You're right.
I'll see you again...

175
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,543
Thank you, Asuka,
for getting the swan back.

176
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:22,584
I can't express
my gratitude with words.

177
00:17:22,763 --> 00:17:23,730
My pleasure.

178
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,791
But St. Tail is...

179
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:28,800
I now believe
you are still passionate...

180
00:17:28,943 --> 00:17:30,171
...about catching her.

181
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:34,379
I would appreciate it
if you would continue to be...

182
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,546
...in charge of arresting St. Tail.

183
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,485
Really?!
I'll do my best!

184
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:49,471
What were you scheming?

185
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,811
What are you talking about?

186
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:59,056
Rina. Nothing works
on him right now.

187
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,143
I know that!

188
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:05,082
I know...

189
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:10,286
Because I Iove him!

190
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:11,796
It's all right, it's all right...

191
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:23,947
I heard that Mayor Okajima
and Yabe were arrested.

192
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:25,648
What happened to that maid?

193
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,820
Mayor Morinaka found
a new job for her.

194
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:32,003
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

195
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:37,647
Look, Asuka!

196
00:18:38,152 --> 00:18:40,086
The mayor is praising you
in the newspaper.

197
00:18:40,257 --> 00:18:41,656
That's great!

198
00:18:50,878 --> 00:18:53,312
Are you going
to chase St. Tail again?

199
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:56,609
Of course!
I will definitely catch her!

200
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,892
I won't allow
anyone else to do it!

201
00:19:00,064 --> 00:19:02,589
Hold on!
Come and catch me!
