1
00:00:06,305 --> 00:00:08,865
You can't beat a hot bun
in winter, can you?

2
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:11,073
Mmm. It's the best!

3
00:00:14,354 --> 00:00:17,448
Oh, my. Meimi, that big mouth.
It's really un-ladylike!

4
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:21,828
Well then, I'll just have another.

5
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:23,270
What?!

6
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:25,667
It's gone!

7
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:37,396
Those are my buns!
Give them back to me!

8
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:41,464
Meimi, wait a minute!

9
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:44,343
Hold it!

10
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:50,046
Look out!

11
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:57,327
Meimi, pull yourself together!

12
00:01:00,346 --> 00:01:02,507
I'm so glad you're okay.

13
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,654
What's with that dog?!

14
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,295
Run After a Jewel Thief!
Little, The Naughty Dog

15
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,376
Little?

16
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:20,545
He's quite popular
at that park.

17
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:23,722
They say he goes off
with whatever he pleases.

18
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,551
With a name like "Little"
and a big body like that...

19
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:28,121
what a strange thing to call him.

20
00:01:28,202 --> 00:01:31,262
But I feel sorry for Little.

21
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:33,001
Sorry?

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,641
Little's original owner was
transferred to work abroad...

23
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:39,245
because of his job.

24
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:43,686
Little was left with a friend...

25
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,601
but the friend's wife
didn't like him.

26
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,435
He doesn't get
any attention at all.

27
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:53,112
I see.

28
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:57,682
He's trying to get attention
by taking people's things.

29
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:14,355
This bun is really delicious.

30
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,702
Wasn't that good?

31
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,341
Here...

32
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,720
Go get it!

33
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,506
Little! Here we go again!

34
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:44,177
Fetch!

35
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,034
Are you alright?

36
00:03:01,288 --> 00:03:02,687
Haneoka, what do you
think you're doing?!

37
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:04,782
Have you got some kind of
grudge against me?!

38
00:03:05,162 --> 00:03:06,220
What?!

39
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:08,562
It's your fault for reading
the paper while walking!

40
00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:12,732
I read the paper to gather
information on St. Tail.

41
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:14,142
Not very much help, is it?

42
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,738
She just keeps slipping
past you every time.

43
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:17,182
What's that?!

44
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:18,277
What about it?!

45
00:03:20,426 --> 00:03:23,862
The Jewel Thief Appears!

46
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:31,207
Hey, you! Wait!

47
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,989
Hey, I said hold it!

48
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:42,232
Darn dog running
into a place like this.

49
00:03:47,113 --> 00:03:48,273
I see.

50
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:50,973
He hides the things
he steals in that hole.

51
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:52,010
Little!

52
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:57,589
You shouldn't do
things like this!

53
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:00,635
Right?

54
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,407
You two...

55
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,849
There it is!

56
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:13,829
Hey, brother, that's it!
The raccoon stuffed-animal.

57
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,331
I'll go get it back.

58
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:19,667
What are you doing?!
Get to work!

59
00:04:19,711 --> 00:04:21,372
Ouch! What are you doing, brother?!

60
00:04:21,448 --> 00:04:22,676
Hey, Mister!

61
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,148
I'd like this stuffed animal.

62
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:27,052
Yes, welcome!

63
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:29,493
"Stuffed Toy Shop CHILD"
Here you are.
Thanks for waiting.

64
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:39,272
Little is an innocent, good dog.

65
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:41,783
Not the best looking, but...

66
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:45,090
Is it possible you're
jealous of Little and me?

67
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:48,865
Don't be stupid.
I like you best of all.

68
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,727
Akira, everything will be fine.

69
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:05,900
Your prayers will surely
reach God.

70
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:16,240
That boy, Akira, took the
stuffed animal raccoon from Yoko.

71
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:18,917
He likes her so much...

72
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:20,931
he probably did it
to get her attention.

73
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:27,341
Akira, regretting what
he had done...

74
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:30,041
tried to return the
stuffed-animal right away.

75
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,287
But someone stole the
stuffed animal from him.

76
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:38,894
Who would do such
a terrible thing?

77
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,569
Well, the culprit is a dog.

78
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,435
A dog?

79
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,101
Do you mean, Little?

80
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:50,509
We know that the stuffed animal
is somewhere in that park but...

81
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:52,285
Hold it!

82
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:59,034
I'll get that stuffed animal.

83
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:02,138
Meimi!

84
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:04,679
Little!

85
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,315
Maybe he's not here today?

86
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:10,653
That's strange.

87
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,223
He's not over here, either.

88
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,894
What?

89
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,645
The stuffed animal is gone.

90
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:23,921
Little!

91
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:29,859
Hey! Be quiet!

92
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:31,471
You idiot!

93
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:33,634
Why did you bring the dog along?!

94
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:35,846
What could I do?!

95
00:06:35,882 --> 00:06:38,214
He wouldn't let go
of the stuffed animal!

96
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,852
Let's just get out of here!

97
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:57,249
Little!

98
00:06:57,326 --> 00:06:59,317
Shut up! I just got
the baby to sleep!

99
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:01,957
Oh, it's alright.

100
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:03,593
I'm very sorry.

101
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,802
Little!

102
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:07,341
Little, where are you?!

103
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:26,239
Hey, be quiet!

104
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:41,210
You caused a lot of trouble.

105
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:45,549
He's the one that
made the mistake...

106
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,352
and put the toy out for sale!

107
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:50,760
Hey brother, let's stop doing
this stuffed-animal business.

108
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:53,660
We're supposed to be jewel thieves.

109
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:55,528
You idiot!

110
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,908
The stuffed animal-toy shop is
to camouflage the jewel thefts!

111
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:01,207
How dumb can you be?

112
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:02,221
Never mind!

113
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:04,315
What counts is that
the jewel is back.

114
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:09,422
We hide the stolen jewels
in the stuffed animals.

115
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,596
When things cool down...

116
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,630
we can take them to another
city and pawn 'em off.

117
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:14,470
It's a great racket.

118
00:08:14,613 --> 00:08:17,081
The only thing left
is to get rid of the dog.

119
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:24,087
You're gonna kill him?!

120
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,224
That's outrageous!

121
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:27,494
Even if he's a dog...

122
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,473
we can't let anybody
who knows about us get away.

123
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:39,453
Little!

124
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,964
Where has he gone?

125
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,938
Hold him still!

126
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:49,503
Brother, I don't like
this sort of thing!

127
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:56,820
You imbecile!

128
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:58,393
Sorry.

129
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:00,294
After him!

130
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:02,766
Little...

131
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:06,105
Little!

132
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:22,545
Little!

133
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:24,140
You're alright, aren't you?!

134
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:27,616
Hey, that tickles!

135
00:09:31,032 --> 00:09:32,124
Hey! Hold it!

136
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,798
Where have you been all this time?

137
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,576
Little!

138
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:44,789
Yipes! Get out of sight!

139
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:47,287
What's the matter?!

140
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:53,097
What? Is there something wrong here?

141
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:57,413
Okay, okay!

142
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:07,737
That's Yoko's raccoon!

143
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,365
Hey! What are you doing?!

144
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:13,514
Little, stop it!

145
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:17,451
Ah, may I take a look around
in this warehouse?

146
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,189
This place is off-limits.

147
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:21,396
Jerk.

148
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:22,298
What's that?!

149
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:23,601
Oh, nothing.

150
00:10:23,638 --> 00:10:25,162
Thank you very much.

151
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,278
Can we just let
them go like that?

152
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:33,953
We've got no choice.

153
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:35,253
We'll have to change plans.

154
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,172
Mr. Asuka Jr.

155
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:49,615
St. Tail!

156
00:10:56,704 --> 00:11:00,299
"I'll be picking up a
stuffed-toy raccoon..."

157
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:01,872
"from the number one warehouse.
- St. Tail."

158
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:04,547
A stuffed-toy raccoon?

159
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:08,423
What's she gonna do
with a thing like that?

160
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:17,696
Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

161
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:24,045
One!

162
00:11:26,463 --> 00:11:27,828
Two!

163
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,863
Three!

164
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:49,032
Looks like it's necessary for St. Tail
to make an appearance after all.

165
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:53,072
But I wonder what the raccoon
is doing in a place like that?

166
00:11:53,851 --> 00:11:57,719
That storage area is rumored
to be connected with criminal activity.

167
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,056
Be very careful.

168
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:00,261
Sure.

169
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:01,365
I'll be fine.

170
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,561
I'm only going there
to get that stuffed animal.

171
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:09,166
May the blessings of
God be with us!

172
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,927
Not even St. Tail would be able
to get past this security.

173
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,068
Well, there's no way into the
warehouse other than this door.

174
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,106
Don't underestimate St. Tail!

175
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:43,005
Stay on guard.

176
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:44,215
Yes sir!

177
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,448
Asuka Jr! What's that?!

178
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,852
What?!

179
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:55,469
St. Tail!

180
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,639
Everyone! Stay at your posts!

181
00:12:57,712 --> 00:12:58,542
Yes, sir!

182
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,816
I've got you now, St. Tail!

183
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:14,633
A rubber doll?

184
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,345
Oh, no!

185
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:19,584
Asuka Jr!

186
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:26,826
One!

187
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:28,430
Two!

188
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,600
Three!

189
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,616
Darn it!

190
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,853
St. Tail has gotten
into the warehouse!

191
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:56,951
St. Tail, today I'll get
you for sure.

192
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:04,409
It's...

193
00:14:07,317 --> 00:14:09,012
Show...

194
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:13,751
Time!

195
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:20,273
What's going on?!

196
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,293
Why?

197
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,290
Yoko's raccoon isn't here!

198
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,967
Darn it!

199
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,139
Oh, no!

200
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,713
Hold it! St. Tail!

201
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:47,183
Where could Yoko's
raccoon have gone?

202
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:04,695
Little?!

203
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:07,024
Why are you here?

204
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:09,234
Wait, Little!

205
00:15:15,153 --> 00:15:17,144
Could the raccoon be here?

206
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:24,233
Someone's here!

207
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:29,411
Little!

208
00:15:30,216 --> 00:15:31,740
This is bad! Hide over there!

209
00:15:36,663 --> 00:15:37,925
You!

210
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:49,244
Where are you?! St. Tail!

211
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:05,649
You won't get away!

212
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:12,831
Thank you, Little.

213
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:15,897
Darn it!

214
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:36,874
What are you doing?!

215
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,328
You're jewel thieves, aren't you?

216
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:07,631
So what if we are?

217
00:17:09,615 --> 00:17:10,445
Okay...

218
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:12,474
hand that thing over.

219
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:29,308
Hurry up and hand it over!

220
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:35,759
What! That mutt!

221
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:22,991
A diamond!

222
00:18:33,282 --> 00:18:34,146
You...

223
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:41,493
Akira returned the
raccoon to Yoko.

224
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:43,591
They've really become close.

225
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:46,264
The jewel thieves
have been arrested.

226
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:48,299
So I guess we can consider
this case closed, right?

227
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:50,437
We owe it all to Little, don't we?

228
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:52,875
That's right.
Little deserves the credit.

229
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,402
That dog, why was he
at the warehouse?

230
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:08,841
Little...

231
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,282
I'll race you to that tree!

232
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:11,985
Ready!

233
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:13,223
Go!
