1
00:00:02,028 --> 00:00:03,757
Meimi Haneoka is 14 years old.

2
00:00:04,032 --> 00:00:07,433
By day, she is a happy student of
St. Paulia School.

3
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:11,267
But at night, she becomes the thief,
St. Tail, to do good deeds...

4
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:15,079
for all who ask for help from Seira,
a nun in training.

5
00:00:16,223 --> 00:00:20,182
Looking to capture the elusive St. Tail
is an amateur detective...

6
00:00:20,464 --> 00:00:22,796
and Meimi's classmate, Asuka Jr.

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,037
And Meimi? She may have more than a bit
of interest in such a determined boy...

8
00:00:30,886 --> 00:00:35,653
I Hate Wedding Veils

9
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:41,831
So what are you going to do?

10
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,000
Are you going home?

11
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:45,938
Well, I guess I'll go with you.

12
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,743
Thank you!
Now that it's decided, let's hurry!

13
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:00,939
Oh! It's already full!

14
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:04,171
It sure is popular.
Shall we come another day?

15
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:05,113
No way!

16
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:09,317
I didn't get any last time and today,
I wanna eat some chocolate chip!

17
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,730
You're acting very immature.

18
00:01:12,034 --> 00:01:13,399
Yeah, just like a child!

19
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,474
Your obsession with ice cream
proves your lack of maturity.

20
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,317
Keep your opinion to yourself!

21
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:23,851
It's popular with
college girls, too, you know!

22
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:27,321
Those college girls
are just as immature as you.

23
00:01:30,337 --> 00:01:32,237
Just who are "you" calling immature?

24
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,701
Look who's talking!

25
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:35,712
You're barely out of diapers!

26
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:37,613
Should we teach him
how to have fun?

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,146
Um... I... Goodbye!

28
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:57,048
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:57,626 --> 00:01:58,888
Heaven's punishment.

30
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:00,058
But still...

31
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:01,960
Here.

32
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:03,066
It's nothing.

33
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:04,067
But...

34
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:05,563
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:10,576
I'm really sorry.

36
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:13,487
It's all right.

37
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:16,893
Meimi...

38
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:18,256
What is it?

39
00:02:21,373 --> 00:02:22,169
See ya!

40
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:39,037
Oh, welcome home!

41
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,002
I'm back.

42
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:44,341
What's the matter Meimi?
You don't look very happy.

43
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:47,278
The happiness of a family
comes from healthy greetings.

44
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,550
Let's try again!
Welcome home!

45
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:54,394
I'm back!!

46
00:02:58,113 --> 00:02:59,478
My new trick...

47
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:01,515
Meimi!

48
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,995
Looks like she's in a bad mood.

49
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,700
Maybe she did badly on a test?

50
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:16,479
What's that jerk's problem?

51
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,854
Oh, Ruby, I'm sorry!

52
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:26,795
I didn't mean to snap at you.

53
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,268
Why am I so irritated?

54
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:35,581
He's not supposed to
mean anything to me and still...

55
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,495
I don't get it.

56
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:45,203
I don't even know why I feel this way.

57
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:47,471
How annoying!

58
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:04,897
God, please grant my wish.
Thank you.

59
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:07,207
I'm so glad...

60
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:08,214
Yeah.

61
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:10,278
Oh, there you are.

62
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:15,288
Oh, how beautiful!
It's a wedding veil, right?

63
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:19,834
It's really pretty.

64
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:21,911
Papa, why is it here?

65
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:23,412
Who is it for?

66
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:25,785
Does it make you happy, Sayaka?

67
00:04:27,024 --> 00:04:29,083
The wedding veil is for you.

68
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:31,189
For me?

69
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,299
It's a gift from your fiance.

70
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,030
Isn't it wonderful, Sayaka?

71
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,538
Yes, isn't it?

72
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:51,896
Meimi, Seira, good morning!

73
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:52,971
Good morning!

74
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:53,905
Good morning.

75
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:56,741
What's the matter Meimi?
You don't look too happy.

76
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:58,980
Maybe she's found
that special someone!

77
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:03,456
Who is it? Who is it?

78
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:06,256
Today is an important day...

79
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:09,132
but you haven't prepared
for it at all, am I wrong?

80
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,169
That's right...

81
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,978
Oh no! I haven't prepared either!

82
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:16,512
I'm sure you're well prepared,
aren't you, Seira?

83
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:18,682
Tell me, tell me!

84
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:21,688
Studying is something
one must do on their own.

85
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:23,125
That's harsh.

86
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,661
That's just how she is.

87
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:28,300
You've got ten minutes
until class starts.

88
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:29,907
Excuse us...

89
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,776
Seniors...

90
00:05:32,154 --> 00:05:33,985
They're the badminton club freshmen.

91
00:05:34,558 --> 00:05:35,820
Aren't they cute?

92
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:37,494
Oh... that girl is...

93
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:39,564
That's Sayaka Shinomiya.

94
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,168
She's cute and really popular.

95
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:44,334
I hear she lives in an
old mansion at the edge of town.

96
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:54,350
Hey, I wonder what
she's staring at so intensely.

97
00:05:54,632 --> 00:05:58,090
You're right.
She's staring pretty hard.

98
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:22,145
So the wedding veil is a
token of your engagement?

99
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:27,416
Yes, but...
I've never even met him.

100
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:33,801
My parents arranged
the engagement themselves.

101
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:36,880
You poor thing.

102
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,616
On top of that I...

103
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:42,349
There's someone else I'm in love with!

104
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,172
Oh, I see.

105
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:55,146
I don't want to be engaged
to a stranger!

106
00:06:55,988 --> 00:06:59,355
If only that veil would disappear!

107
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:03,266
Please!

108
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,299
Please give me the strength
to dissolve this engagement.

109
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:11,006
May the blessings of God be with you.

110
00:07:18,032 --> 00:07:21,195
And there's nothing
Sayaka can do about it?

111
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:22,966
It seems that way.

112
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:29,542
All right! St. Tail shall steal
that wedding veil!

113
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:35,057
Even if the person Sayaka
is in love with is Asuka Jr.?

114
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:40,432
Gross! What terrible taste!

115
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:43,103
What are you going to do Meimi?

116
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:45,776
Why are you asking
me something like that?

117
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:47,148
Then you don't mind?

118
00:07:47,924 --> 00:07:51,416
Of course not!
St. Tail never has second thoughts!

119
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:54,992
I'll steal that wedding veil,
no matter what!

120
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,099
Just as I thought.

121
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,286
So you see, they completely
disregarded a young girl's feelings.

122
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:10,632
It's unforgivable.
Isn't that right, Ruby?

123
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:36,349
"Tonight, I'm going to steal a
wedding veil from...

124
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:38,185
the Shinomiya residence."

125
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,191
What?!

126
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:44,325
What's all that noise
this early in the morning?

127
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,864
It's a vocal warm up!

128
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:50,012
Forget it.
Music doesn't run in our family.

129
00:08:50,717 --> 00:08:51,945
Is that right?

130
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:57,525
I know I told her to
keep me informed, but...

131
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,241
I guess I won't wash my face.

132
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,779
Hey, what are you doing?
Hurry up and eat.

133
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:31,061
Look, I made a really good
sunny-side-up egg today.

134
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:32,299
I don't want any.

135
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:34,596
What's with you?

136
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:38,832
When you make them, you grumble
if anything is left on the plate.

137
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,971
I don't want to eat!

138
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:43,483
A growing boy like you?

139
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:46,519
If I eat, the note might dissapear.

140
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:48,721
I've just got some stuff going on!

141
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:51,126
What, you found yourself a girlfriend?

142
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:52,832
Don 't be stupid!

143
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:58,476
Why do you keep your back turned?
When you talk to somebody, face them!

144
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:03,755
I've got stuff going on so... see you!

145
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,070
Is that really St. Tail's note?

146
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,565
That's amazing!

147
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:11,539
Sure is.

148
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:15,204
But you're a real idiot, having slept
through her writing it on your face.

149
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:16,510
Shut up!

150
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:18,213
Let me touch it real quick!

151
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,459
Stupid! Don't touch it!
Your hands are dirty!

152
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:21,552
How silly...

153
00:10:21,665 --> 00:10:22,563
Hey, come on.

154
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:27,433
Cut it out, you idiot! Knock it off!
She's mine! I'm gonna get her!

155
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:29,269
What was that?

156
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,908
But why?

157
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:37,256
Even if the person Sayaka
is in love with is Asuka Jr.?

158
00:10:45,413 --> 00:10:46,437
Coming!

159
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:51,019
Asuka...

160
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,589
Hi.

161
00:10:56,969 --> 00:11:00,962
...therefore I'd appreciate
you letting me stake the place out.

162
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:02,977
Uhm...

163
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:04,842
Are you sure about this?

164
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,046
There's no doubt about it!

165
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:13,555
St. Tail has never gone back
on a warning or failed in a caper.

166
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,832
If you take her lightly,
you'll be in a terrible situation.

167
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:22,541
Let's go over the
plan for this evening.

168
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:25,688
On top of getting the veil stolen,
I can win over Asuka Jr., too.

169
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:28,955
If this is the case, I wish
Miss Thief could come every night.

170
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:37,042
Well, time to work.
Gotta help those in trouble.

171
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:51,000
What's the matter?

172
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,272
I thought I heard
something in the yard.

173
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:57,076
I think someone's out there.

174
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,057
In situations like this
it's usually a cat.

175
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:04,492
Meow.

176
00:12:05,606 --> 00:12:07,437
You're right. Just a cat.

177
00:12:09,614 --> 00:12:11,411
She's my daughter, all right.

178
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:35,419
Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

179
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:41,932
One!

180
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:45,172
Two!

181
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:48,685
Three!

182
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:08,051
May the blessings of God be with us.

183
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:10,499
Well, then...

184
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:12,862
Are you really going Meimi?

185
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:13,903
I'm going!

186
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:18,814
If I were Sayaka, I wouldn't want
an engagement like that, either!

187
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:25,319
If the veil is returned, I'm sure
the engagement will be called off.

188
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,293
Can you do it, St. Tail?

189
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:31,940
Without a doubt, if it's God's will!

190
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:37,278
This "Tail" thief is probably thinking
of entering through the attic.

191
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:44,789
So I'm going to stand watch in the room
directly below the attic, for an ambush.

192
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:48,943
But, what if she enters
from a different place?

193
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:51,972
If I say she's coming through here,
that's how it will be.

194
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:56,512
I've met up with her many times
and I know what to expect.

195
00:13:57,897 --> 00:14:00,525
Are you absolutely sure it's okay?

196
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:06,235
Papa, don't be rude to Asuka Jr.!

197
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:11,679
Papa, Mama, will you wait outside?
Asuka and I will keep watch here.

198
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:14,752
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:14,964 --> 00:14:16,522
Well, it's true.

200
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:20,329
I'm sure you'll be able to catch her!

201
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:23,137
What's all this?

202
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:26,916
Okay, just watch!

203
00:14:30,228 --> 00:14:31,752
There's something odd...

204
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:36,800
St. Tail never steals without a reason.

205
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,478
Why would she want
to steal a wedding veil?

206
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:42,942
Well that's...

207
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:44,076
Mr. Asuka!

208
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:45,922
The inner courtyard...!

209
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,372
Hurry and do something!

210
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,948
Even if she uses a decoy
or some sort of camouflage...

211
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,851
there's nothing to worry about!

212
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:07,962
I'm not such a dimwit that I'd
be caught with the same trick twice.

213
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,805
He's not falling for my tricks.
How boring.

214
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:18,685
Well, if he's looking for a challenge,
I'll give him one!

215
00:15:27,443 --> 00:15:31,539
The security is pretty bad.
No guards or anything so far.

216
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:43,364
The wedding veil and
Asuka Jr. are waiting just for me!

217
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,066
One small setback.

218
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:49,279
But, with the veil right in front of me,
I can't back down now!

219
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:56,555
St. Tail! You've taken the bait!

220
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:07,918
Applause!

221
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:11,684
Applause, my foot!
That's no fair! You idiot!

222
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,863
Let me go! She's going to get away!

223
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:16,335
But I'm scared!

224
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:17,565
Let go!

225
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,707
Miss Thief, take it away!

226
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:22,348
Let me go!

227
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:27,454
She's gonna escape!

228
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:28,621
I don 't care!

229
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:35,937
Stealing this veil means Sayaka's
engagement will be called off.

230
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:38,976
It's the right thing to do, but...

231
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,389
She's mine!

232
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,005
I'm gonna catch her!

233
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,959
Darn it!

234
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:10,733
Wait! Answer me one question!
Why are you stealing that?!

235
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:15,212
Are you just a thief, after all?!

236
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,188
Haven 't you always stolen
to help those in trouble?!

237
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,741
How about you?!

238
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,641
How about you? Why don't you
ever understand how a girl feels?!

239
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,353
If you want to know who
the troubled one is, ask Sayaka!

240
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,331
You super-dingbat!

241
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:44,208
Ding... bat?

242
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:52,156
She got away again.

243
00:17:56,774 --> 00:18:00,175
I won't give up!
I'll never give in to you!

244
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:03,307
Darn it!

245
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:14,570
So, St. Tail dissolved
the engagement?

246
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,013
She returned the wedding veil
to the sender's house.

247
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:24,324
Then, he got angry
and called off the engagement.

248
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:28,927
Thank you very much, Asuka Jr.

249
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,208
Hey, it's not right to thank me.

250
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,911
But I'm so happy!

251
00:18:37,555 --> 00:18:38,783
Stop it.

252
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,060
C'mon... cut it out!

253
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,130
Excuse me.

254
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:47,501
What is it?

255
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:53,239
Haneoka, what are you doing?
Hey! Hold it!

256
00:18:53,354 --> 00:18:56,380
Darn it, why am I always
chasing after...

257
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:05,435
What is it? What's so funny?

258
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,108
What have you written?

259
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:11,782
It's best you don't know.

260
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,785
"I hate you!"

261
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,124
Hey, Haneoka!
