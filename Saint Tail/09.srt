1
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:12,184
Well?

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,132
Hi!

3
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:19,101
What are you doing, Haneoka?

4
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:20,871
There's going to be a contest.

5
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,170
A contest?

6
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:24,542
You know Miki from our class?

7
00:00:24,754 --> 00:00:25,345
Yeah...

8
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:29,221
She's entering the Junior Design Contest
that the city's putting on.

9
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:32,864
And I'm going to
model the wedding dress!

10
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:35,140
Model? You?

11
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:37,973
She said I'm perfect for it.
I've already gone for the fitting.

12
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:41,415
I'm just waiting to see
the finished product.

13
00:00:41,557 --> 00:00:43,752
And who's going to be the groom?
The Frog Prince?

14
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:47,260
Frog's Bride

15
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:49,338
How rude!

16
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:53,342
Asuka Jr., you're always
making fun of me!

17
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:57,281
It's nothing, I'm just being honest.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,086
Why you!

19
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:03,968
Miss Takamiya...

20
00:01:06,212 --> 00:01:11,115
Contest in Chaos

21
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:31,260
Is there something you want from me,
Miss Takamiya?

22
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:34,837
Oh, nothing.
I just happen to be going this way, too!

23
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:36,205
Don't mind me.

24
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:37,945
I see.

25
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:54,512
Darn. She got away.

26
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:04,261
Hush, Meimi.

27
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:07,143
You must be quiet in the chapel.

28
00:02:07,446 --> 00:02:09,573
I finally got away from Takamiya.

29
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:13,048
She's been following me all over
the for place the past few days.

30
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,918
Really?
She's very persistent, isn't she?

31
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:19,434
By the way,
have you seen Miki?

32
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,871
My wedding dress
is supposed to be ready today!

33
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:29,416
She... came to see me about that,
just a little while ago.

34
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:31,596
She did?

35
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:34,098
Yes. The truth is...

36
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:38,709
What did you want
to talk to me about?

37
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:42,714
Someone stole the
drawing for my design.

38
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:44,724
Who'd do such a thing?

39
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:46,061
I think I know.

40
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:57,285
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I have such long legs.

41
00:02:58,324 --> 00:02:59,518
Miss Suzushiro...

42
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:04,461
It's Suzushiro from Group E.
We're competing in the same contest.

43
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,402
Mami Suzushiro?

44
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:11,546
Yes.
I'm sure that's when it was stolen.

45
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:14,919
She's always thought
of me as a rival.

46
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:22,469
If she uses my design in the contest,
it'll put me in a difficult position...

47
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:28,248
because her presentation
comes before mine.

48
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:32,589
I don't know what to do.

49
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:34,495
Miki, don't lose faith.

50
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,807
The right will always be rewarded.

51
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,988
And that's what happened.

52
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:49,156
I see... and I was
looking forward to the contest.

53
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:54,173
Meimi, please get
her design back for her.

54
00:03:54,782 --> 00:03:56,807
Alright! Leave it to me.

55
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:59,183
At least, I wish I could.

56
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:01,285
It's Miss Takamiya.

57
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:05,026
With her following me around,
I can't turn into St. Tail.

58
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:08,400
Don't give up hope.
You'll think of something, Meimi.

59
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:10,740
I'm trying!

60
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:15,348
I want to wear that wedding dress
and model in the contest too! But...

61
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:18,821
I understand.
I'll help you this time.

62
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:20,495
You will?

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,038
I'll fix you an alibi.

64
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:27,848
In the meantime,
you become St. Tail and get the design.

65
00:04:28,155 --> 00:04:30,885
Hold on.
What do you mean by alibi?

66
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:36,657
First, you specify the contest's date
on the challenge to Asuka Jr.

67
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:37,734
Okay.

68
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,538
And then...

69
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:43,209
"...at the Conversational
English Seminar..."

70
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:46,383
Hey, Asuka, are you listening?

71
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:48,129
Be quiet, will you?

72
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:52,626
I asked you if you wanted to know
St. Tail's identity!

73
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:54,071
Are you still harping on that?

74
00:04:54,112 --> 00:04:57,240
What a pest.
I told you what I think.

75
00:04:57,353 --> 00:05:01,312
I don't care who she is!
I just want to arrest her!

76
00:05:02,597 --> 00:05:04,497
All right then, I won't tell you.

77
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:06,771
Fine, I don't care.

78
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,469
Junior Design Contest.

79
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:14,978
So this is what Haneoka's
been worked up about.

80
00:05:15,493 --> 00:05:17,222
What's so great about it, anyway?

81
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:23,765
"Tomorrow,
at the Junior Design Contest...

82
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:29,647
I will steal Mami Suzushiro's wedding
dress design drawing. -St. Tail"

83
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:31,726
Of all the nerve!

84
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:33,556
I've been waiting for this.

85
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,532
I knew she'd make a move.

86
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,761
That St. Tail...
she's after a wedding dress this time!

87
00:05:37,976 --> 00:05:40,137
I'm going to follow
my own lead this time.

88
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,112
Good luck!

89
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:42,307
Huh, what?!

90
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:45,353
We'll soon learn
St. Tail's true identity.

91
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:49,362
Suit yourself!

92
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:04,626
You were so cute back then, Mama.

93
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:07,803
And you were a bit slimmer, Papa.

94
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:12,707
No magic will bring
back the old you, huh?

95
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:14,179
Of all the...

96
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:16,621
Change back,
change back, change back...

97
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:18,924
or something like that... wow!

98
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:27,411
Oh, it's you, Meimi.

99
00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:29,444
Shame on you.

100
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,117
You're a professional magician.
That shouldn't catch you off guard.

101
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:34,723
Well, I... what's up, Meimi?

102
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:39,505
There's a wedding
dress contest tomorrow.

103
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:43,109
I'm one of the models.

104
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:52,425
She's going to get married
one of these days, isn't she?

105
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,276
It's too early
to start getting lonely, Papa.

106
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:04,995
Tomorrow, I have to
be St. Tail and a bride.

107
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:07,994
I've got to work hard at both!

108
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,606
What's wrong?

109
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:16,478
You want to go with me?

110
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:20,629
I'm sorry, Ruby, you have to stay home.

111
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:40,437
Hey you,
you better do a good job protecting me.

112
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:43,437
Sure, of course,
to some degree.

113
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:44,984
What do you mean,
'to some degree'?!

114
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:51,692
I mean, St. Tail is sure to appear
after the contest begins. That's why...

115
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:53,200
You're positive?

116
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,299
Yes, that's why you
can relax until then.

117
00:07:56,547 --> 00:07:57,639
So, I'll see you later.

118
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:02,313
I think they can protect themselves.

119
00:08:02,526 --> 00:08:04,118
Green Room 1

120
00:08:13,016 --> 00:08:14,813
What are you doing here,
Miss Takamiya?

121
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:16,188
Nothing.

122
00:08:16,424 --> 00:08:20,758
I was looking for a phone.
I have to call Asuka.

123
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,360
You there.

124
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,266
Me?

125
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,573
You're not wearing an ID tag.

126
00:08:25,744 --> 00:08:29,145
Only models and contestants are
allowed in here. Please leave.

127
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,496
She's sticking to you like glue.

128
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:39,168
She's not moving from that spot,
not for anything.

129
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:44,339
Seira, are you sure it's all right
for me to participate?

130
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:46,712
You have nothing to worry about, Miki.

131
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:48,887
Right, hang in there.

132
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,027
Get out of the way!

133
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:53,334
You're in my way!

134
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:55,200
Is that Mami Suzushiro?

135
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,338
Yes.

136
00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:00,482
That dress!

137
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:02,981
It's definitely the one I designed.

138
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:06,359
I won't let them get away with this.

139
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:12,004
Let's put on a good show,
shall we, Kono?

140
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,880
Yes. Of course.

141
00:09:14,384 --> 00:09:15,851
See you later, then.

142
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:23,862
The city's Junior Design Contest
will soon begin.

143
00:09:24,373 --> 00:09:26,773
Final preparations are being made.

144
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:30,076
All contestants,
please assemble on the stage.

145
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:32,151
I have to go.

146
00:09:32,557 --> 00:09:34,388
I'll be there as soon as I change.

147
00:09:34,796 --> 00:09:37,663
Don't worry, I'll help her change.

148
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,867
Thank you. I'll leave it to you.

149
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,681
Takamiya, you're welcome to watch.

150
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:47,915
Oh, gee, thanks.

151
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:57,566
Seira, let's get going.

152
00:09:57,946 --> 00:09:58,776
Okay.

153
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:05,352
She's changing.

154
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:09,297
We've got to be quiet.

155
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:15,069
Oh Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

156
00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:21,156
One!

157
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:24,533
Two!

158
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:28,066
Three!!

159
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:44,505
Oh, dear!

160
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:48,153
Transforming into
St. Tail quietly is so hard!

161
00:10:49,193 --> 00:10:50,091
Meimi.

162
00:10:56,374 --> 00:10:58,774
Oh Seira, you're beautiful!

163
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:03,312
Once I put on the wig and veil,
everyone will think it's you.

164
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:06,248
Oh dear, and I'm supposed to be a nun.

165
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,699
I'm counting on you to put on
a good act and keep Takamiya here.

166
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:13,841
I will, be careful too.

167
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:19,252
May the blessings of God be with us.

168
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:25,593
What are those two doing in there?

169
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:40,431
Miss...

170
00:11:41,574 --> 00:11:44,634
Judging by your looks
you must be one of the models.

171
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:48,083
The contest is starting.
You'd better change.

172
00:11:48,623 --> 00:11:50,113
But, I'm...!

173
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,821
Is this your dressing room?

174
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:53,025
No.

175
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:54,900
Then it's this way.

176
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:56,171
W... Wait a minute!

177
00:11:56,908 --> 00:11:58,307
You're making a mistake!

178
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:01,040
Meimi, now's your chance.

179
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:02,045
Okay.

180
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:11,693
I thought I saw a black shadow there.

181
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:14,000
It must have been your imagination.

182
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:17,974
Oh boy.

183
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:19,180
Show's starting.

184
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:21,149
I'm so nervous.

185
00:12:21,194 --> 00:12:21,819
Me, too.

186
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:30,608
Everything is going good so far.

187
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,850
Now for the hard part.

188
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,324
We will begin the judging at this time.

189
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:41,102
Entry #1.

190
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:48,307
Hey!

191
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:49,952
No!

192
00:12:50,058 --> 00:12:51,252
My design!

193
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,927
Look! What's that?

194
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,447
When is she going to
turn into St. Tail, I wonder?

195
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:05,784
Hurry up, Meimi.

196
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,631
Haneoka, don't you have to go?

197
00:13:10,035 --> 00:13:12,196
Yes, but my number is last.

198
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:13,840
Hmmm.

199
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:22,682
Oh, Meimi, please hurry!

200
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:28,972
Whoah!

201
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:36,622
Good evening!

202
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,370
Please, God!

203
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:53,920
We are experiencing a power failure.
For your safety, please remain seated.

204
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:56,957
St. Tail is here in the hall!
What are you doing?!

205
00:13:57,573 --> 00:14:01,100
That's impossible!
Haneoka's still here.

206
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:04,617
Meimi.

207
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:08,323
The entire hall is in an uproar,
but stand by, okay?

208
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,055
Okay.

209
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:14,533
Takamiya?

210
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,574
Phew. They're gone.

211
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,950
Now, I've got to get this ready.

212
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:27,064
Everyone, quiet, please.

213
00:14:27,304 --> 00:14:29,898
What's going on there?!

214
00:14:31,347 --> 00:14:32,405
That's the dress.

215
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:38,854
It's Show Time!

216
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:45,973
Hey! Wait! What is this?!

217
00:14:47,515 --> 00:14:49,813
Sorry, you have to wear that instead.

218
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,850
I'm taking the design.

219
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:58,258
I'm giving this back
to the real designer.

220
00:14:58,474 --> 00:14:59,236
What?!

221
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:01,502
Don't just stand there, get her!

222
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,410
Just hold it! What does she mean,
'real designer'?!

223
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,245
Um...!

224
00:15:05,522 --> 00:15:08,457
And this is in apology
for causing such a commotion here.

225
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:17,606
Wow!

226
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,172
Bouquets?!

227
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:26,029
For the future brides.

228
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,570
Hold it!

229
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:30,504
Bouquets from St. Tail!

230
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:31,272
I want one too!

231
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:32,142
Ooh, they're beautiful!

232
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,345
Outta my way!

233
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:37,679
Let me through!

234
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:41,189
She got away.

235
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:46,133
And what are you doing?!

236
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,611
None of your business!

237
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:49,644
Junior Designer Contest

238
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:52,916
There, it's finished.

239
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,958
Fly up high.

240
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:08,216
Asuka!

241
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:09,951
She's heading for the exit!

242
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:19,647
She got away again.

243
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,287
Where's Meimi?

244
00:16:23,827 --> 00:16:24,987
Takamiya!

245
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:26,558
Now where's she going?

246
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:27,793
Green Room 1

247
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:32,033
Impossible.

248
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:36,984
What'd you come back here for?

249
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:53,319
Well, Asuka Jr., isn't she beautiful?
For goodness sake, say something.

250
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:54,923
Miki, that's enough.

251
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,529
Yeah, really beautiful.

252
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:03,906
Really very beautiful...

253
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:06,184
Your design that is.

254
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:08,079
Oh my, thank you.

255
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,790
But that's not what I meant!

256
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,795
So... So that's what St. Tail was after!

257
00:17:16,075 --> 00:17:20,011
He's trying to change the subject.
How typical of a man.

258
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:24,548
Asuka, let's go.

259
00:17:24,895 --> 00:17:26,055
O... Okay.

260
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:30,693
Entry #30, you're up next.
Report to the stage immediately.

261
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:31,866
Meimi, let's go.

262
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:32,705
Yes.

263
00:17:40,896 --> 00:17:43,797
Hey, Takamiya,
you can go without me.

264
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,662
Asuka, where are you going?

265
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:47,875
It's none of your business!

266
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:48,776
Bye!

267
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:55,684
And the winning entry in
the Junior Designers Contest is...

268
00:17:57,099 --> 00:18:00,535
#30, Miki Kono's design!

269
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:04,409
Miki, you did it!

270
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:05,346
Congratulations!

271
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:06,582
Meimi!

272
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,352
It's not fair!

273
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:16,867
A wedding dress sure is mysterious.

274
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:19,470
It even makes Meimi seem different.

275
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:22,717
And what if she's St. Tail?

276
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:24,018
What?

277
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,723
I'm asking you how you'd feel
if she was St. Tail?

278
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:32,594
What are you talking about?
That's a really bad joke.

279
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,309
It's no joke.
I'll even make a bet on it.

280
00:18:35,617 --> 00:18:39,212
Stop it! Is that why
you've been following her around?

281
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,153
She's one of your classmates.

282
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,961
All right, how about this then?

283
00:18:44,236 --> 00:18:49,333
If Meimi isn't St. Tail,
then I'll stop following her.

284
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:51,008
You promise?

285
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:55,652
But if I'm right, you'll have to date me.

286
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:56,319
What?

287
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:58,730
Well?

288
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:01,663
You promise you'll stop following her?

289
00:19:04,113 --> 00:19:05,171
All right.

290
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,414
There's no way...

291
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:14,187
that Meimi is St. Tail.
