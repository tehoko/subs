1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,040
Meimi Haneoka is 14 years old.

2
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:07,739
By day she is a happy student
at St. Paulia School.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,924
But at night, she becomes
the thief St. Tail...

4
00:00:10,962 --> 00:00:13,396
to do good deeds for all who
come asking the help of Seira...

5
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:15,198
a nun in training.

6
00:00:16,342 --> 00:00:20,574
Looking to capture the elusive
St. Tail is an amateur detective...

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,611
and Meimi's classmate, Asuka Jr.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,223
As for Meimi...

9
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:28,257
she may have more than a bit of
interest in such a determined boy.

10
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:34,778
Legend of Happiness?
The Clock Tower Commotion

11
00:00:44,813 --> 00:00:47,714
Did you see the ad
for the Wonder Garden?

12
00:00:47,754 --> 00:00:49,915
It just opened this month.

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,626
Oh, I love amusement parks!

14
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,233
Actually, I've already been there.

15
00:00:56,343 --> 00:00:57,708
Who with?!

16
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:00,544
If you must know...

17
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:05,291
Look, it's Tominaga from class C!

18
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:06,691
Since when?

19
00:01:07,503 --> 00:01:11,371
It's a wonderful place.
The flowers are really lovely.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,244
But the main attraction is... this!

21
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,888
The mechanical clock
of Wonder Castle!

22
00:01:17,963 --> 00:01:19,954
The dolls move and it's so beautiful.

23
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:23,901
It was built by a famous
foreign doll-maker.

24
00:01:24,145 --> 00:01:27,740
Every one of his creations
costs a huge amount of money.

25
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:30,347
Also, it's said that if...

26
00:01:30,394 --> 00:01:34,831
you watch this clock with the one
you love, it'll bring happiness.

27
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:36,498
And you watched it together!

28
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:37,774
Yeah.

29
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:39,748
How wonderful!

30
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:43,882
I'm jealous, I've never
even been on a date.

31
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:46,627
Who do you want to date, Meimi?

32
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:50,159
Don't tell me
you want to date Asuka Jr.

33
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:51,975
Don't be silly!

34
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:54,807
Who'd want to date
a dinky detective like him?!

35
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,748
Just who do you think
you're calling "dinky"?!

36
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,453
If that bugs you,
why don't you go ahead...

37
00:01:58,498 --> 00:02:00,159
and catch St. Tail,
you bungling detective!

38
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:03,170
Even if I do capture her,
I'm not letting you see her!

39
00:02:03,243 --> 00:02:05,404
Who cares, she's not like
some beetle on display, is she?!

40
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:06,278
Shut up!

41
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:07,511
Same to you!

42
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:10,146
Hey, Asuka!

43
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:12,357
Yeah, I'm coming.

44
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:17,374
Seira...

45
00:02:21,956 --> 00:02:23,150
What is it?

46
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,252
Meimi, there's only one reason
why I would ask you to come here.

47
00:02:27,236 --> 00:02:29,864
I have a favor to ask of St. Tail.

48
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:32,345
Something that only she can do.

49
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:34,618
The doll at the amusement park?

50
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,986
Yes, and it's located
in a very high place.

51
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:38,990
You mean that amusement park?

52
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:41,758
Yes, Wonder Garden
Amusement Park.

53
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:43,807
Then, by a high place,
you must mean...

54
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:46,402
The mechanical clock
of Wonder Castle.

55
00:02:47,253 --> 00:02:50,279
This girl tied a precious doll
that she had brought with her...

56
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:52,295
to the strings of her balloons.

57
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:54,126
This is the doll you
want me to get?

58
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:57,771
Yes, she borrowed the doll
from a friend...

59
00:02:57,846 --> 00:03:00,246
and must return it
the next time they meet.

60
00:03:01,221 --> 00:03:02,449
However...

61
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:18,721
The doll!

62
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:43,086
They contacted the
amusement park...

63
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:47,318
but were told to forget
about the doll.

64
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:50,066
All I have to do is
get the doll back.

65
00:03:50,344 --> 00:03:51,777
That's easy.

66
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,805
Only, you have to get
it back by Sunday.

67
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:56,511
Sunday... that's tomorrow.

68
00:03:57,061 --> 00:04:01,930
The doll's owner is coming to the
girl's house tomorrow to play.

69
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:03,041
She needs it by then.

70
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,838
Which means I have
to do it tonight.

71
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:08,441
And the doll emerges from
the clock on the hour.

72
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:12,293
So you have to get the doll
before the balloon carries it away.

73
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,457
Okay, leave it to me.

74
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:19,072
I'm home!

75
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:21,216
Welcome back, Meimi.

76
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:23,255
What's up?

77
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:24,155
This...

78
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:26,325
You haven't gone
there yet, have you?

79
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,267
Huh...? No.

80
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,076
We were just about to go.
Do you want to come, too?

81
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:38,386
It'll complicate things
if I go with them...

82
00:04:38,798 --> 00:04:40,857
You want to go, don't you?

83
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:42,026
Yes.

84
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:43,502
Good.

85
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,273
Besides, you might find
some ideas for new magic tricks.

86
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:51,314
Jeez, they always use
me as an excuse.

87
00:04:56,609 --> 00:04:58,167
You want to come?

88
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:01,348
But I've got work to do...

89
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:03,920
Ready yet?

90
00:05:04,162 --> 00:05:05,595
Almost.

91
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:08,764
I want you to stay home
and watch the house.

92
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:21,256
It's been a long time since I've
been to an amusement park.

93
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:24,533
It's time for the doll to come out.

94
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:27,678
Hey, hey... what's the rush?

95
00:05:28,623 --> 00:05:30,591
I have something I want to see!

96
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,404
There.

97
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:40,071
It's almost time.

98
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:45,388
Asuka Jr.!

99
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:46,490
Haneoka!

100
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:48,900
What brings you here?

101
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,205
To have fun... what else?

102
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,177
Yeah, that makes sense.

103
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,653
So that's the clock tower
the girls were fussing over?

104
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:05,675
When you watch it with
the one you love...

105
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:07,046
it brings happiness.

106
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,658
Why don't they come out?

107
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:17,072
Hey there, what's going on?

108
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,873
Is something wrong?

109
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:20,815
It's just some malfunction.

110
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:23,754
There's a temp repairman here,
if I remember correctly.

111
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:25,421
Yes, I'll get him!

112
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:29,067
They say it's just
some malfunction.

113
00:06:29,107 --> 00:06:30,267
See you.

114
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:35,511
Ah! ...My balloon!

115
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:37,887
That's right.

116
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,125
At least I can check
if the balloons are still there.

117
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:42,269
Too bad, Meimi.

118
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,274
I'm going to go get some ice cream.

119
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:51,650
"Employees Only"

120
00:07:00,018 --> 00:07:02,612
Oh, it's a costume.

121
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,272
Good, it's still there.

122
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,158
Good work.

123
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:21,299
All I did was remove a gear.

124
00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:22,669
Piece of cake.

125
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,972
The big job's coming up.

126
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:29,579
Identical dolls.

127
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,683
Why bother with all this stuff?

128
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:34,029
Why not just go ahead and steal it?

129
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,331
The police are on guard.

130
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:38,502
Sometimes it's better
to use your brain.

131
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:40,546
Well, faking a malfunction...

132
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,781
and switching the dolls
during the repair...

133
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:44,019
I guess that's using your brain.

134
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:46,319
Which means those are all fakes!

135
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,160
Who's there?!

136
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,850
Cool it! It's nothing!

137
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:57,649
Okay, let's get to work.

138
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:07,916
They won't
get away with this!

139
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,892
Bye.

140
00:08:15,974 --> 00:08:18,135
Please come by.

141
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:26,458
It's an ad for Wonder Garden.

142
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:32,869
"I'm going to Wonder Garden
tonight to get the doll... St. Tail."

143
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:33,940
How dare she!

144
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:35,385
She was in that
rabbit costume!

145
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,835
I'll return this later.

146
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:46,311
Haneoka!

147
00:08:48,957 --> 00:08:50,185
What?!

148
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:51,887
That amusement park...

149
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:55,662
That clock at Wonder Castle
with the dolls that's said to...

150
00:08:57,344 --> 00:08:58,777
You mean...

151
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:03,108
bring happiness to couples when
they view it together.

152
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:04,319
Yeah.

153
00:09:04,362 --> 00:09:07,160
Is he trying to ask
me to go with him?

154
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:10,033
About how much is it worth?

155
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:12,172
Excuse me?

156
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,108
Is it true that it's very expensive?

157
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,450
It's supposed to be.

158
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:21,563
Why would she do
something so villainous?!

159
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:26,238
I got it, never mind.

160
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:27,475
See you.

161
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:32,452
What's with him, anyway!

162
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:34,524
I hate him!

163
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,006
He's so insensitive.

164
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,850
Oh, look who's grouchy.

165
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:00,624
I'll take you the next time I go.

166
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:04,341
I've got to get to work.

167
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:06,881
Meimi.

168
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:14,161
Meimi?

169
00:10:14,237 --> 00:10:15,465
Are you there?

170
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,132
Oh, no!

171
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:18,840
What's wrong?

172
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:20,473
She's not answering.

173
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:27,124
What are you doing over there?

174
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:32,511
I was thinking of going to
get some juice or something.

175
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:34,478
From the window?

176
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:36,489
I thought I'd try something new.

177
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,256
I'll be off, then.

178
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:43,638
Going in and out
of the window at night.

179
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:46,444
She's my girl, all right.

180
00:11:03,827 --> 00:11:07,490
Please forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

181
00:11:12,783 --> 00:11:13,909
One!

182
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,882
Two!

183
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,028
Three!

184
00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:40,443
May the blessings
of God be with us.

185
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,661
That doll was specially made.
It's invaluable...

186
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,440
There's only one of its
kind in the world.

187
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:08,452
If it were ever stolen...

188
00:12:08,757 --> 00:12:10,190
Please be rest assured...

189
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:13,691
St. Tail always has some
reason for stealing.

190
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:15,198
I'm sure it's the same this time.

191
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:16,797
You can't be too sure.

192
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:17,673
Dad!

193
00:12:17,712 --> 00:12:22,513
If the latest artwork thefts
are the work of St. Tail...

194
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:25,122
then everything falls into place.

195
00:12:25,498 --> 00:12:27,193
No, it can't be.

196
00:12:27,303 --> 00:12:28,998
You're still green, son.

197
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,975
She may be called "Saint", but
she's no more than a thief.

198
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,876
I'm done with the repairs for now.

199
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:37,554
All right, thanks.

200
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:38,562
Don't mention it.

201
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:40,121
What an idiot.

202
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:42,595
If St. Tail is going to appear...

203
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:45,806
it'll be when the dolls come out.

204
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:49,414
What the...?!

205
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:07,296
"These dolls are fake!
St. Tail"

206
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:08,795
St. Tail!

207
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:10,369
When did she...?!

208
00:13:10,778 --> 00:13:13,269
Don't tell me she
switched them with fakes!

209
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:16,488
St. Tail! Where is she?!

210
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,551
Stay calm, don't leave your posts!

211
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:23,137
They still don't get it?
Talk about dense.

212
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,387
I won't let you get away!

213
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,265
She's trying to confuse us
with bits of paper!

214
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:38,777
I can see right through you.

215
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:40,845
Light her face up! Her face!

216
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,491
I can see right through you, too!
If you want to light up something...

217
00:13:45,665 --> 00:13:47,428
leave it to St. Tail!

218
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:51,404
It's Show Time!

219
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:55,282
The lights are moving by themselves!

220
00:14:15,673 --> 00:14:16,970
What's going on?

221
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:19,703
We don't light up at night.

222
00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:21,417
Now for the real show.

223
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:30,202
Hold it! St. Tail!

224
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:44,971
I can't see!

225
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:09,503
Identical dolls.

226
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:11,474
These!

227
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:12,808
These are the real ones!

228
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,476
And there's the statue
that was stolen last week.

229
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:17,483
Dad!

230
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,363
You're under arrest!

231
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:30,852
Ouch, you're squashing me, too!

232
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:48,061
St. Tail!

233
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,612
The rest of you, go after St. Tail!

234
00:16:00,803 --> 00:16:02,065
Here goes.

235
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:02,832
One...

236
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:03,906
Two...

237
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:05,341
Three!

238
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:12,463
Asuka Jr!

239
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:14,291
Which one should we arrest?!

240
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:16,171
Yikes!

241
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:19,781
What the...?!

242
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:22,911
Do you have a St. Tail parade
or something at this amusement park?!

243
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:24,823
Of course not!

244
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:33,148
I lost her.

245
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:38,852
Fantastic, isn't it?
St. Tail's illusion parade!

246
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:44,161
There's no way to
find me in all this.

247
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,248
No way!

248
00:17:04,797 --> 00:17:05,855
Don't underestimate me.

249
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:08,526
No matter where you go...
I'll find you!

250
00:17:09,107 --> 00:17:10,267
How?

251
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:13,944
You're not getting away!

252
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,389
Asuka Jr.! That's dangerous!

253
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:26,473
Fool!

254
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:27,848
I won't...

255
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:30,485
miss this chance!

256
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,843
Like I said... I'm taking
the doll with me!

257
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:40,346
The doll...

258
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:43,582
That's the doll
you wanted?

259
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,860
If you had asked me out,
it would've made me happy.

260
00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:50,205
But...

261
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,038
it turned out to be
like a date, anyway!

262
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:54,608
I really enjoyed myself!

263
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,379
Date...?

264
00:17:57,562 --> 00:17:59,029
Cut the jokes!

265
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:06,413
I'm serious, you know!

266
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:18,535
I'm serious... darn.

267
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,981
Thank you, Asuka Jr.

268
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,797
All of the dolls have been recovered,
thanks to you.

269
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:32,806
Those two turned out to be the ones
responsible for the art thefts.

270
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:36,979
I thought it was strange
for her to do such a thing.

271
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:37,786
What?

272
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,089
No, it's nothing.

273
00:18:53,335 --> 00:18:55,895
Don't ever tie it to
a balloon again.

274
00:19:06,735 --> 00:19:09,727
It brings happiness if you watch it
together with the one you love.

275
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:11,701
Well, who cares...

276
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:16,942
My nights are always filled
with the prospect of happiness.
