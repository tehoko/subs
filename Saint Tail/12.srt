1
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:12,291
Good morning!

2
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:13,995
Good morning, Meimi.

3
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:14,902
Good morning.

4
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:17,505
Good morning. It's getting
so cold these days.

5
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:20,174
Of course it is.
Christmas is almost here.

6
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:23,821
Christmas. Wouldn't it be nice
if it snowed?

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:24,954
It certainly would.

8
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:28,696
Has anybody noticed how quiet
the class has gotten lately?

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,111
And the reason is
right over there.

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,618
Asuka Jr.?

11
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:39,490
He hasn't received any notes
from St. Tail lately.

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,362
And that's why
he's been down in the dumps.

13
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,572
I understand how he feels.
He misses the chase.

14
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:50,254
Is that why he's so gloomy? How silly.

15
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:53,562
Cheer up, Asuka Jr.!

16
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:58,402
Oh. It's only you, Haneoka.

17
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,710
How rude.

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,111
So what if St. Tail doesn't appear?

19
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:03,750
It only proves
the world is at peace.

20
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:05,058
Shut up.

21
00:01:05,902 --> 00:01:08,166
How can you jabber so much
first thing in the morning?

22
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,036
That's why I can't stand
the girls in this class.

23
00:01:11,348 --> 00:01:12,713
What do you mean by that?

24
00:01:12,752 --> 00:01:16,745
You're all nosy, loud-mouthed
and unfeminine on top of that!

25
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:21,835
Okay, then tell me
what's your ideal girl like, huh?!

26
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:23,303
Come on, tell me!

27
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:25,909
It's not you, that's for sure!

28
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:29,019
There's no such thing
as the perfect girl.

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,124
Yes, there is!
Take St. Tail, for example.

30
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:39,569
What's wrong with you?
It's always St. Tail, St. Tail.

31
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:42,951
Idiot!

32
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:48,399
Meimi?

33
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,672
You moron!
I hate you!

34
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:59,127
I'm St. Tail.
And if I'm her, then why...

35
00:02:05,683 --> 00:02:10,643
Surprise!
The Large Lizard Santa Claus?!

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,897
Mayu, isn't it?
There's no one here but me.

37
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:29,634
You can tell me
your problem now.

38
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:34,706
Sister, Goh stole Tama from me.

39
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:35,847
Goh?

40
00:02:35,993 --> 00:02:39,554
He's in my class
and he's so mean.

41
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:41,564
I'm not even bothering him...

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,938
but he kicks my blocks
and hits me with the ball.

43
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:46,608
And he's the one
who stole your pet, Tama?

44
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:48,317
Uh huh.

45
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:51,291
Did you tell your mother?

46
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:58,369
But Mama hates animals.
She said he should keep Tama.

47
00:02:58,448 --> 00:02:59,415
I see.

48
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:02,617
I really love Tama.

49
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,063
I understand. Don't cry.
I'm sure God will help you.

50
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:08,530
Really?

51
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:13,950
And that's the story.

52
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:17,919
Goh is really Gohta Ogasawara.
He's five years old.

53
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,530
And he lives on the hill
on the outskirts of town.

54
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:22,770
And what does Tama look like?

55
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:26,746
She's black in color and
has a ribbon around her neck.

56
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,920
I think she'll be easy to spot.

57
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,921
Alright. I guess I'll go now.

58
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:36,201
Wait, what about a
note to Asuka Jr.?

59
00:03:36,678 --> 00:03:39,306
Forget it.
Who cares about that promise?

60
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:42,778
That means
you'll be breaking the promise.

61
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:44,692
I don't care!

62
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:47,332
Meimi...

63
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:50,936
He only thinks of St. Tail!

64
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,710
I'm not sending another
note to that guy. Not ever!

65
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:03,038
The bully's room
should be underneath me.

66
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,874
Pardon me.

67
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,298
So you're the little meany.

68
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:30,564
You'd better start
thinking about how girls feel.

69
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:34,080
Or you'll end up like
a certain blockhead I know.

70
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:43,462
Phew. Gee, I almost forgot.
Now, where's that Tama?

71
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:52,554
Here Tama... Oh, Tama...

72
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:10,470
Black in color,
with a ribbon. It can't be, can it?

73
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,674
TAMA
Are you Tama? I thought you'd
be a cute little black cat.

74
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:27,142
What'll I do?
I'm too scared to touch it.

75
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:29,853
Which means I can't steal it.

76
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:31,726
This is ridiculous.

77
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,789
My reputation is at stake.

78
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:53,144
Tama, what's the matter?

79
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:05,134
Huh?

80
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:09,817
I'll call it quits for tonight.
I've got to get away.

81
00:06:13,502 --> 00:06:15,367
Detective Asuka, over there.

82
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:18,276
After her.

83
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:21,143
It's St. Tail! After her!

84
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:24,117
Oh no!

85
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:36,787
We've got her cornered now!

86
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:38,523
Look out!

87
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:48,513
I warned you.

88
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,459
Oh, damn!

89
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,336
Detective Asuka!

90
00:06:57,145 --> 00:06:58,112
Don't hang on to me!

91
00:06:58,147 --> 00:06:59,409
I can't help it.

92
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:00,279
Let go of me!

93
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,255
-Don't do that, sir!
-Help, I'm sinking!

94
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,630
St. Tail appears!
But what is her target?

95
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:10,306
The mystery thickens!

96
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:14,775
Detective Asuka
misses the arrest by an inch!

97
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,220
It's been pretty long
since St. Tail's last caper.

98
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:22,164
I heard your Dad came close
to capturing her this time.

99
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:23,840
Isn't that right, Asuka?

100
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,706
Shut up!
She never sent me a note!

101
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:29,422
That's not my fault.

102
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,750
Who does she think
she's dealing with, anyway?!

103
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:33,659
Calm down, Asuka!

104
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:36,533
I was waiting for a note!

105
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:39,673
Why'd she do it
without letting me know?!

106
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,417
What'll I do?
It's all my fault.

107
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:47,952
Cheer up. I'm sure she just
forgot her promise to you.

108
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,031
She's not like that!
She'd never break her promise.

109
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:54,310
Then I'm sure she has
a very good reason.

110
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:55,843
Just mind your own business!

111
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:59,892
I don't want to hear your ideas
about St. Tail's motives!

112
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:04,999
What?! You'll never capture St. Tail,
not in a million years!

113
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:07,777
Oh, be quiet!
You don't know anything!

114
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:08,820
Oh, yes I do!

115
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:09,948
Liar!

116
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:14,525
Yes, I do!
Because I'm St. Tail!

117
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:15,929
Meimi!

118
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:19,040
Huh?
What was that about St. Tail?

119
00:08:19,383 --> 00:08:20,281
Oh no...

120
00:08:33,718 --> 00:08:36,744
Oh, brother,
I can't believe I said that.

121
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:42,867
Ruby, do you think
Asuka caught what I said?

122
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:48,408
SEIKA NEWS STATION

123
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:54,161
Good evening.
This is the Seika News Station.

124
00:08:54,738 --> 00:08:58,139
Our first story this evening features
the city's Christmas Eve festivities...

125
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,114
Hey, you!
How'd you get in here!

126
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:01,243
You shouldn't be here!

127
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:05,824
Mama, come look at this.

128
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:08,627
What is it, Papa?

129
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:13,404
Isn't that Meimi's classmate on TV?

130
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:14,213
Where?

131
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:17,086
Give me a break!
I'll make it quick!
See? It's that smart kid.
The mayor's pride.

132
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:19,719
That's not possible right now!
You're right.
I wonder what he's doing.

133
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,090
Meimi!

134
00:09:21,638 --> 00:09:22,400
Grump!

135
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:23,671
Ow! Get him!

136
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:25,139
Hey! Hey! That's my mic!

137
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:26,181
What is it, Mama?

138
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:27,012
St. Tail!

139
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:30,661
I have a message for St. Tail!
Meet me tonight at Park A!
Look, isn't that boy in your class?

140
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:31,889
I have a message for St. Tail!
Meet me tonight at Park A!

141
00:09:32,231 --> 00:09:34,256
I'll be waiting alone!

142
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:38,644
I'm doomed.

143
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:42,047
If you don't come,
I'll reveal your identity...

144
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:43,215
...to the entire city!

145
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:48,826
There's no escaping those eyes.

146
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:52,141
Quick! Cut the cameras! Cut!
You hear me?!
I'll repeat it once more!

147
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:54,045
Please Stand By
SEIKA TV

148
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:57,883
St. Tail, eh?
I'll bet she's a beauty.

149
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:00,196
Just like when you were younger.

150
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:03,303
Hey, I'm still beautiful!

151
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:06,536
Meimi, what do you think?

152
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:09,446
Meimi? Huh?

153
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:27,123
You mustn't go. It's a bluff.

154
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:29,929
It might be one
of Asuka Jr's. tricks.

155
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:36,415
You're right.
Do you think I'm crazy?

156
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:41,629
If I'm going to be caught,
I have this funny feeling...

157
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:44,003
it'd be better if Asuka
was the one to catch me.

158
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:45,840
Meimi...

159
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:48,547
Do you think
I shouldn't go, Seira?

160
00:10:51,964 --> 00:10:54,592
It wouldn't do any good
to stop you, would it?

161
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:57,000
But listen, Meimi.

162
00:10:57,311 --> 00:11:00,405
You must never reveal your
identity to him on your own.

163
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:04,019
You must take him by surprise
as you've always done.

164
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:04,958
But...

165
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:09,056
We don't know how much
he really knows, do we?

166
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:14,909
Besides, you have
a job to do tonight.

167
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:15,716
I do?

168
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:17,347
Yes, for Mayu.

169
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:21,024
Oh, that's right.
I haven't gotten Tama back yet.

170
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:26,564
Poor Mayu. She's been waiting
anxiously for Tama.

171
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:30,120
You're right. But why
does it have to be tonight?

172
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:34,330
The truth is,
Mayu and her family are moving...

173
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:36,530
to another city far from here
tomorrow, Christmas Day.

174
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:38,165
She's moving away?

175
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:45,488
Mayu, just forget about it.

176
00:11:47,536 --> 00:11:51,734
That's why tonight
is the last chance you have.

177
00:11:54,152 --> 00:11:55,676
Alright, Seira.

178
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:59,017
Let's give her an
unforgettable Christmas.

179
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:00,433
Yes.

180
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,964
Meimi, when the time comes that
you're captured, we'll go together.

181
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:17,594
Lord, forgive me
for I use no gimmick or trick.

182
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,554
One!

183
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:27,229
Two!

184
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:31,465
Three!

185
00:12:46,884 --> 00:12:50,479
May the blessings
of God be with us!

186
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:04,183
Maybe she wasn't watching TV.

187
00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:16,613
Snow... It's going to be a white
Christmas. Brr... it's freezing.

188
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:24,932
Well, I guess
she's not going to show.

189
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:49,058
What's that?
St. Tail!

190
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:57,618
You must take him by surprise,
as you've always done.

191
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:02,929
I don't know what good it'll do but...

192
00:14:06,114 --> 00:14:09,413
It's Show Time!

193
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:16,000
What is this?

194
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:20,469
Will you stop?
I've had enough of this!

195
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:26,458
Why do you think
I left that cell phone over there?!

196
00:14:27,802 --> 00:14:31,761
Listen! I'm not leaving here,
so you can just relax!

197
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:34,276
Did you hear me?

198
00:14:34,486 --> 00:14:38,855
Yes! But you said
you'd reveal my identity...

199
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:40,064
It was a bluff!

200
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:43,796
Oh, brother.
He doesn't know.

201
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:46,672
Never mind that.
Why didn't you send me a note?

202
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:48,479
How do I explain?

203
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,757
Is that why you called me here?

204
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:54,630
This is very important,
so listen!

205
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:56,399
You know what it means...

206
00:14:56,441 --> 00:14:58,136
if you don't let me know
where you're going to strike.

207
00:14:58,612 --> 00:15:00,705
It means I won't be there!

208
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:06,286
And that means... um... er...
let's put it this way...

209
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:10,393
What'll happen if
somebody else captures you?

210
00:15:11,946 --> 00:15:13,140
I mean...

211
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:16,177
Oh... what I'm saying!

212
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:17,381
I...

213
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:19,824
I'm coming over.

214
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:20,863
What?

215
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:25,733
Forgive me, Seira.

216
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:30,474
You must never reveal
your identity to him on your own.

217
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:33,289
But... I...

218
00:15:36,908 --> 00:15:39,741
Darn, the glass is
so fogged up, I can't see.

219
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:46,789
St. Tail.

220
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:54,708
Hello.

221
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,451
Uh, hello.

222
00:15:59,164 --> 00:16:00,290
My promise...

223
00:16:02,138 --> 00:16:07,440
I'm sorry I broke my promise.
I'll never do it again.

224
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,908
Yeah. Okay.

225
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:11,358
That's why...

226
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:13,989
What is it?

227
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:16,061
That's why...

228
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,406
I don't want you to
give up on me.

229
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:22,343
I have to go.

230
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:29,020
St. Tail! Don't get caught
until I catch up with you!

231
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,864
Alright!

232
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,912
It's a promise!
Don't you forget!

233
00:16:38,228 --> 00:16:39,092
Right.

234
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:57,997
"I am going to
the Ogasawara residence..."

235
00:16:58,044 --> 00:17:01,013
"this evening to take
their pet, Tama - St. Tail."

236
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,479
Tonight?!
I don't have much time left!

237
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:08,094
Darn her!

238
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:13,275
I'm sorry,
but tonight's the only night.

239
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:15,542
Hey! Tama's not here!

240
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,053
"Don't be mean to little girls!"

241
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:28,545
Oh, shoot!

242
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:33,725
What's that?!
St. Tail has shown up!

243
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:37,735
Daddy, Mommy, wake up -
you gotta see this!

244
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:39,772
Santa is flying in the sky.

245
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:41,342
Santa is flying in the sky?

246
00:17:41,386 --> 00:17:42,944
You must be dreaming.

247
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:46,521
What is that?

248
00:17:50,776 --> 00:17:52,209
Santa Claus?

249
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:54,946
It's Santa!

250
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:05,100
Wow! Presents from Santa!

251
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:18,506
Police vehicle coming through!

252
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:23,648
Clear the street!
I repeat, clear the street!

253
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,891
Darn... she got away.

254
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:32,740
Mayu, forget about Tama and go to bed.

255
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:41,396
It's Tama! Tama's come home!

256
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:45,901
Tama, oh Tama!

257
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,746
I guess we have no choice but
to take Tama with us, right, Mayu?

258
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:53,091
Hurray!

259
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:53,893
Hurray!

260
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:04,684
St. Tail...

261
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:07,523
I'll get you
for sure next time!

262
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:10,864
Merry Christmas!
