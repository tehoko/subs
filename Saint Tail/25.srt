1
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:32,208
St. Tail, that's as far as you go.

2
00:00:54,694 --> 00:00:58,095
You've done it, Inspector Kitamura!

3
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:01,561
-Thank you for your trouble.
-Yes.

4
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:04,939
That was just perfect!

5
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:10,116
It's no good.
The real St. Tail is much faster.

6
00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:14,015
No matter how many simulations
we do, it's no good.

7
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:18,790
I'd like the chance to meet the real
St. Tail as soon as possible.

8
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,471
I'll get her for sure.

9
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:25,041
St. Tail, prepare yourself.

10
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:31,051
A STRONG FOE!
CONFRONTING AN ELITE DETECTIVE

11
00:01:34,465 --> 00:01:36,956
Doesn't Asuka Jr. seem a bit down?

12
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:39,468
Maybe his idol gave him
the cold shoulder.

13
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,835
Are you serious?

14
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,709
Lately, St. Tail hasn't been
showing herself, right?

15
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:49,621
So that's it.

16
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,920
Still, he's really down, isn't he?

17
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:55,664
Looks like it.

18
00:01:59,777 --> 00:02:02,439
I heard about it, Asuka Jr.!

19
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:06,847
The police department has put together
a team to arrest St. Tail.

20
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:12,853
Heard that your father's lending
a hand in it too.

21
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:16,832
Don't bother me.
It isn't a big thing. Just routine.

22
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:27,816
Sawatari, what's the news?
Let me in on it!

23
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,392
According to Takamiya...

24
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:39,543
...looks like the police have finally
put together a team to catch St. Tail.

25
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:42,581
And they're bringing in
a secret weapon!

26
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:45,221
What's that supposed to be?

27
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:50,596
It's a super detective, the first ever
for the police department.

28
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:54,668
Well, just hold on to your horses
for the rest.

29
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,437
I'll be back with more fantastic news.

30
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,081
Meimi.

31
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:13,197
-Asuka Jr.!
-What is it?

32
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,434
Don't let it bother you.

33
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,138
No matter what kind of
super detective they bring in...

34
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:21,947
...he'd never be a match for you.

35
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:24,551
Obviously!

36
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:27,059
Asuka Jr.!

37
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:42,986
May I help you?

38
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:46,494
I'm surprised. Such a cute Sister.

39
00:03:46,736 --> 00:03:48,670
Is there something I can do for you?

40
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:54,107
So you were in the art business.

41
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:58,318
Yes, my wife and I travel worldwide...

42
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:02,324
...collecting all sorts of artwork.

43
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:08,035
-I'm sure you make a wonderful couple.
-But my wife has fallen ill.

44
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:10,174
Angel's Smile?

45
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:14,712
To pay for my wife's medical expenses,
I had to sell our works of art.

46
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,446
But only that statue of the angel...

47
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:22,319
...I had no intention of letting go
of Angel's Smile.

48
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:25,730
But the owner of the Parkside Museum
tricked me.

49
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,941
Oh, my.

50
00:04:27,576 --> 00:04:30,306
He was to borrow it
only for the exhibition.

51
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:34,143
But before I knew it, he said
that I had sold it to him.

52
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:36,523
Can't something be done?

53
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:42,720
Nothing. Without me knowing, he made
documents saying I had sold it to him.

54
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:44,131
That's horrible!

55
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:48,074
Just one more time...

56
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:54,378
...I want to display the Angel's Smile
beside my wife's pillow.

57
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:59,492
I'm sure God will grant you
your wish. I'm sure.

58
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:08,311
Mr. Asakura's wife is
in quite bad health.

59
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,418
So there isn't much time left.

60
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,256
I'm a bit worried.

61
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:20,159
According to my information,
the police's secret weapon...

62
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,928
...is really something.

63
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:24,433
What's so super about this detective?

64
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:26,738
I don't know all the details...

65
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:30,919
...but this brilliant detective
has solved many tough cases.

66
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:37,397
I see. But I'm gonna show that lady
the Angel's Smile one more time!

67
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:41,072
No matter the opponent,
I can't run without a fight!

68
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:44,608
That would tarnish St. Tail's name!

69
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:57,130
You're being a pest.

70
00:05:57,438 --> 00:06:01,306
Oh, come on, just one. Pose!

71
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:04,036
Leave me alone!

72
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:14,026
"I'll be at the Parkside Museum tonight
to pick up Angel's Smile. -St. Tail"

73
00:06:14,636 --> 00:06:18,732
-It's a note from St. Tail!
-Is it for real?

74
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:24,172
-So you're Asuka Jr.
-And just who are you?

75
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:28,984
Metropolitan Police, special
investigations, Inspector Kitamura.

76
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:31,594
I'm in charge of
the St. Tail investigations.

77
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:35,132
-You're the--
-Wow!

78
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:50,559
-You're joking. She's a detective?
-That's neat.

79
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,964
Wow, the Metropolitan Police has
a woman as its secret weapon.

80
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,142
Kaede Kitamura, 26 years old.

81
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:01,839
After graduating top of her class,
she entered the police department.

82
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:05,750
A normal person would have stayed
on that path to success.

83
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:10,022
She's gone out of her way
to take part in this St. Tail arrest.

84
00:07:14,075 --> 00:07:18,478
Five feet, six inches tall
and approximately 105 pounds.

85
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:24,246
-What are her measurements?
-I'd say it's about 34, 23, 34.

86
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,192
How disgusting can guys be?

87
00:07:28,802 --> 00:07:32,863
St. Tail may be sailing
into rough waters with this one.

88
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:34,633
That's for sure!

89
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,677
I won't lose to her!

90
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:46,454
My Lord, please protect me.

91
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:50,897
Ruby, pray for me too, okay?

92
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:55,537
Worried, aren't you? Thanks.

93
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:59,549
But today's not a good day,
since it'll probably be tough.

94
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:13,242
St. Tail isn't stupid enough
to get caught with this!

95
00:08:13,816 --> 00:08:17,217
We'll have to see about that.

96
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,325
Son, are you all right?

97
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,300
Darn it!

98
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,250
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

99
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,062
One!

100
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:46,505
Two!

101
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:50,639
Three!

102
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,408
Seira, here I go!

103
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:11,548
That woman detective, I heard
she's going to use a special weapon.

104
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:13,187
Please be careful.

105
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:17,693
Don't worry, I know.
I won't be reckless.

106
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:23,699
May the blessings of God be with us.

107
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:38,796
If St. Tail is gonna show up,
it'll be from the ceiling.

108
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,836
She'll slip through their fingers,
so I'll get a head start.

109
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,664
With this, we can identify the
movements of everyone in the museum.

110
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:01,271
Right. It uses an ultraviolet ray.

111
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,310
No matter her disguise,
she can't hide her body temperature.

112
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,782
I see. And that's this red dot?

113
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:14,257
There's an invader
above the exhibition room!

114
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:17,993
Welcome, St. Tail.

115
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,225
That was close!

116
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:57,963
But St. Tail isn't so dumb as
to get caught with this.

117
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,064
Bye-bye.

118
00:11:21,254 --> 00:11:26,123
This seems too easy. Is there really
a secret weapon, I wonder?

119
00:11:26,463 --> 00:11:27,760
It's St. Tail!

120
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:33,965
It's...

121
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:37,412
...Show...

122
00:11:39,386 --> 00:11:41,718
...Time!

123
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:03,085
Just as I thought!

124
00:12:07,402 --> 00:12:11,862
After making such a grand statement,
what's this all about?

125
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:15,405
Everything is going as planned.

126
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:33,980
St. Tail is headed southwest
on First Avenue.

127
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,983
What a cute little thing.
She doesn't even know it's bugged.

128
00:12:39,227 --> 00:12:43,391
If we follow this light,
we'll find out where her hideout is.

129
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:46,898
Tonight is St. Tail's last caper.

130
00:12:47,374 --> 00:12:52,971
Let's see... Where's the hospital
that she's supposed to be in?

131
00:12:53,218 --> 00:12:57,154
Hold it, St. Tail!
Hold it right there!

132
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,250
Asuka Jr.?

133
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:02,590
I was waiting for you!
I'll be the one to arrest you!

134
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:05,062
What a guy!

135
00:13:22,037 --> 00:13:23,868
Darn!

136
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:29,168
I'm definitely gonna be
the one to arrest St. Tail!

137
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:39,796
Inspector Kitamura,
St. Tail is about to land.

138
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:43,733
She's going to
the Seika City Community Hospital.

139
00:13:43,977 --> 00:13:45,274
Why a hospital?

140
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:50,815
The answer is simple. Catch St. Tail
and we'll know everything.

141
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:57,763
Head her off!

142
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:23,770
After she steals, regardless
of how good she is...

143
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:26,006
...she'll let down her guard.

144
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:28,379
Come on over, St. Tail.

145
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:31,590
She's here!

146
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,060
St. Tail, this is as far as you go!

147
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:50,486
You sure blundered this one.

148
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,461
If you didn't get in the way,
we would have had St. Tail!

149
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:58,230
Be quiet! St. Tail's mine!

150
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:00,836
Darn! Let me go!

151
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:02,738
Inspector Kitamura.

152
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:07,319
Don't worry, I'll find her no matter
where she escapes to with this.

153
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:13,261
That woman detective,
how did she know my destination?

154
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:23,710
That's it, run. The tougher
the opponent, the better the game.

155
00:15:50,504 --> 00:15:52,938
- Darn it!
-Just keep cool.

156
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:56,941
Now she's a rat in a sack.

157
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:09,458
How does she know where I'm going?

158
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:17,981
It's a tracking device!

159
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:24,954
Ruby!

160
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:30,066
Ruby, where did you come from?

161
00:16:32,747 --> 00:16:36,513
It's no good. I'm...
It's too small.

162
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:39,253
What shall I do?

163
00:16:40,394 --> 00:16:42,658
No doubt about it. She's in there.

164
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:45,696
-Let's go in.
-Wait a minute!

165
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:53,135
It's moving. The inner courtyard!
No, she's headed out of the hospital!

166
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:57,952
This time, for sure.

167
00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:00,154
It's stopped.

168
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:03,999
That mansion.

169
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:10,638
Uncle, grant me my one and only wish.

170
00:17:10,882 --> 00:17:16,548
Leave the St. Tail investigation
in Asuka Jr.'s hands. Oh, please!

171
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:18,259
I'm sorry to say this...

172
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:22,261
...but by now that woman detective
has probably caught her.

173
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:25,701
What do you want here?

174
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:30,675
Now I've got you cornered!
You're St. Tail, aren't you?

175
00:17:34,591 --> 00:17:36,616
St. Tail, you're under arrest!

176
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:40,160
This is a bad joke!

177
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,635
It's no use trying to escape!

178
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,211
Dear.

179
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,490
Dear.

180
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:17,459
It's definitely an angel
who brought it to us.

181
00:18:24,948 --> 00:18:26,916
Hey, Asuka Jr.!

182
00:18:27,152 --> 00:18:31,987
Heard that you're back in charge
of the St. Tail investigations.

183
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:35,459
Yep. The mayor came
personally to ask me.

184
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:40,695
How disappointing. That woman
detective, she had some real pizzazz.

185
00:18:40,943 --> 00:18:46,609
Looks like I'm the only one
who can catch St. Tail after all.

186
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:52,353
Asuka Jr., good morning!

187
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:56,830
Why the sudden attack?

188
00:18:57,339 --> 00:19:00,831
You're getting so big-headed
early in the morning.

189
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,844
Darn it! You're a real pest!

190
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:06,213
Hold it!

191
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:11,254
Catch me if you can!
