1
00:00:04,118 --> 00:00:06,177
Someone help me!

2
00:00:06,323 --> 00:00:07,813
It's St. Tail!

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,360
She's heading for the
exit on the first floor!

4
00:00:12,102 --> 00:00:14,764
Just as I suspected.
I know she'll come out this way!

5
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:19,749
Here she comes!

6
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:22,789
I've got you now, St. Tail!

7
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:26,966
Darn it!

8
00:00:27,135 --> 00:00:27,999
Asuka!

9
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:31,836
Takamiya!

10
00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:33,106
Better luck next time!

11
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:36,115
Be seeing you!

12
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:39,250
She's getting away again! Darn it!

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,740
Dolphins Vs. Eagles

14
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,181
St. Tail dropped these?

15
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:58,028
Pinch!
Beware of Lost Objects

16
00:01:13,804 --> 00:01:15,669
My form's not all that bad.

17
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,756
Sorry.

18
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,897
I shouldn't have
done that in the chapel.

19
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:27,929
It's all right.

20
00:01:28,403 --> 00:01:29,370
Excuse me.

21
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:35,806
Oh! Are you Oikawa, the pitcher
for the Southern Rainbow Dolphins?

22
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:37,653
You know me?

23
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:40,684
Of course, you're a celebrity!

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,637
I was until last month.
I'm on a losing streak now.

25
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:49,841
Don't give up.
My prayers are with you.

26
00:01:51,354 --> 00:01:52,252
Thanks.

27
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:55,654
And what brings you here today?

28
00:01:56,898 --> 00:01:58,297
Oh, nothing.

29
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:02,972
I may not be of much help...

30
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:05,608
you can share your troubles with me.

31
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:17,130
The truth is I lost my lucky glove.

32
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:17,934
What?!

33
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:25,952
Strike three! You're out!

34
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:33,398
The daughter of our owner's
friend wanted my autograph.

35
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:39,286
May I have your autograph?

36
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:42,386
Sure thing.

37
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:47,303
I asked her to hold the glove
while I signed her board.

38
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:56,551
But then, both she and
my glove disappeared.

39
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:02,369
This was the glove I had used
when I pitched a no-hitter.

40
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:06,275
It brought me luck, and
I'd been using it ever since.

41
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,344
I see.

42
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:12,151
Our next game is for the championship.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,437
I came here to pray for her to return it.

44
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:19,740
When is the game?

45
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:24,380
This Sunday, against the Eagles.

46
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:32,732
Have faith, the Lord
is looking out for you.

47
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:40,576
...and that's why I want you
to get his glove back.

48
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:43,124
OK, Seira.

49
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:44,933
The truth is...

50
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:48,234
...ta-da!

51
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:52,112
I've got tickets to Sunday's game!

52
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:57,358
What? Oh no!

53
00:03:58,633 --> 00:03:59,793
What's wrong?

54
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:03,601
I lost the tickets to
the Dolphins game!

55
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,971
I didn't know you
were a baseball fan.

56
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:12,186
No, it's not for me.

57
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,464
Remember math class the other day?

58
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:20,244
Your score is terrible!

59
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,215
If you score below 30 again...

60
00:04:25,258 --> 00:04:27,818
I'll revoke your recess and
you'll have to go to study hall.

61
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:28,825
What?

62
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,191
Tough luck!

63
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:32,402
Mister Asuka!

64
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:33,199
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,940
I want you to tutor Miss Haneoka.

66
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:36,909
What?!

67
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:40,350
Having an honor student
tutor her should help.

68
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:43,085
-Oh, no! Not him!
-Oh, no! Not her!

69
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,094
Enough of that! This is not
a request, it's an order!

70
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:54,410
I don't quite remember the incident,
but how lucky for you.

71
00:04:54,522 --> 00:04:59,084
That's not luck! Do you know
what he did after class?

72
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:05,505
You know, I'd really like to see the
next Dolphins game at the Big Dome.

73
00:05:07,618 --> 00:05:11,714
Let's make a deal, Miss Haneoka.

74
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:14,459
Are you telling me to treat you?

75
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:18,502
Or you can stay in
study hall during recess.

76
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:19,201
See you.

77
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,540
No, no! It'll be my
pleasure to treat you!

78
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,051
The creep had me cornered!

79
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:28,985
So you have a date with him.

80
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:32,861
You must be looking
forward to Sunday.

81
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:35,138
Don't be ridiculous!

82
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:36,802
It was blackmail.

83
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:40,743
I had to beg Papa for the tickets!

84
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:46,197
And after all that, I've lost them.

85
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:50,940
What should I do, Seira?!

86
00:05:51,681 --> 00:05:54,809
Well, anyway, let's go
look for them tomorrow.

87
00:05:57,995 --> 00:05:59,929
Tickets to the Dolphins game?

88
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,226
I must have dropped them.
Have you seen them around?

89
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:04,574
No.

90
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:06,038
Neither have I.

91
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:07,475
Too bad.

92
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,447
The Dolphins are so popular.

93
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,948
I doubt you'll get more tickets.

94
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,691
Shh! Don't talk so loud.
He might hear you!

95
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:16,933
Hey, Haneoka!

96
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:22,104
Don't forget about Sunday and
I promise you'll score 100 on the test.

97
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,289
She promised to take
Asuka to that game.

98
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:30,924
What?!

99
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:32,732
You're going with him?

100
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:35,600
You two are always fighting!
What gives?

101
00:06:35,878 --> 00:06:39,245
It's not like that!
I can explain!

102
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:41,318
Oh?

103
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:45,159
Um, anyway, I lost the tickets!

104
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:52,641
The tickets St. Tail dropped,
and the tickets Haneoka lost...

105
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:57,245
are for the same Dolphins
game. Could she be...

106
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:12,015
Now I remember! I had them
with me on that last caper!

107
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:21,696
That's it, I must have lost them
while I was escaping.

108
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:32,763
Good show, Meimi!

109
00:07:32,937 --> 00:07:34,336
That was a 10!

110
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:37,933
No, I just got lucky, that's all.

111
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:41,312
I think I overdid it.

112
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:48,160
Such technique...
Quite extraordinary. It must be her.

113
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:49,660
There it goes!

114
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:52,609
Get it, Asuka!

115
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,029
Who picked him to be goal keeper?

116
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:05,133
Asuka, are you alive?

117
00:08:05,742 --> 00:08:08,575
Hey, what's this?

118
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:11,709
"Tonight, I will enter
the Uehara residence...

119
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:15,692
for pitcher Oikawa's glove.
Signed, St. Tail."

120
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:20,064
Hey, Asuka, it's a
challenge from St. Tail.

121
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:22,508
Do you hear me?

122
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:24,839
Snap out of it, Asuka!

123
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:27,949
I just don't get it,
both St. Tail and Takamiya!

124
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:30,357
Why are they always after this guy?

125
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:32,355
Pay attention, will you?

126
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:35,894
Meimi Haneoka...
you're mighty suspicious.

127
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:40,411
Now, to go look for those tickets...

128
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,052
Where do you think you're going?

129
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:46,385
I... I have to go somewhere.

130
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:51,192
No way!
The test is tomorrow!

131
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:09,165
Solving trigonometry problems
is like a criminal investigation.

132
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:14,150
You find each and every clue,
fit them into place, until...

133
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:16,092
Bam! See, you've
solved the problem.

134
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,357
Is detective work all
you ever think about?

135
00:09:18,869 --> 00:09:20,962
Mathematics is one of the
foundations of detective work!

136
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:25,946
Is arresting St. Tail
that important to you?

137
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:32,824
Well, is it?

138
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:35,029
None of your business.

139
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:36,866
What's that mean?!

140
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,568
It's between St. Tail and me!

141
00:09:40,384 --> 00:09:42,443
Why can't you tell me?

142
00:09:48,535 --> 00:09:49,399
Sorry.

143
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:54,335
Now, the next problem...
The angle of a figure on a flat plane...

144
00:09:54,448 --> 00:10:00,318
all the points at a given distance...

145
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:01,784
Hey! Hey!

146
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:06,397
Miss Haneoka!
I'd like to speak to you.

147
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,654
What is it, Miss Takamiya?

148
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:21,269
Here.

149
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,174
Aren't these yours?

150
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:46,913
Actually I found these the other night.

151
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:51,335
Do you want to know
where I found them?

152
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:01,913
Um, thanks, but these aren't mine.

153
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:04,924
Oh, really?

154
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:08,104
Well then, I guess I'll
keep them for myself.

155
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:14,877
Asuka is a big Dolphins fan, right?

156
00:11:16,194 --> 00:11:20,460
I'm sure he'll be happy to go,
if I ask him. Bye!

157
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:24,037
Rats!

158
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:26,110
What'll I do?

159
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:29,550
The game's this Sunday
and I don't have the tickets!

160
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:34,259
And of all people,
why'd Rina have to find them?

161
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:38,364
I've got to get those tickets back.

162
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:42,647
But I could get caught. Still...

163
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:46,124
Still...

164
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:48,596
Don't forget!

165
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:54,965
He was so excited about going.
I can't just tell him it's off.

166
00:11:57,518 --> 00:12:02,387
I said no! This is mine and
I'm not letting anyone take it!

167
00:12:02,796 --> 00:12:06,493
But you have to put
the glove on that table.

168
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:07,501
No!

169
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:10,801
What's so important about this table?

170
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,615
Don't!

171
00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:19,327
What is this stuff?

172
00:12:19,734 --> 00:12:25,764
A special fluorescent paint.
I'm using it to expose St. Tail.

173
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:29,445
Why are you so obsessed
with St. Tail, anyway?

174
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:32,854
I told you, I'm going to
become a detective...

175
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,758
and I'm not letting that ridiculous
petty thief get the best of me!

176
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:38,600
A ridiculous petty thief, eh?

177
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,501
Give it to me!

178
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:42,377
No!

179
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:48,855
I've got a great idea.
This time, we do a double-cross!

180
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:53,600
Oh, Lord, forgive me, for
I use no gimmick or trick.

181
00:12:59,855 --> 00:13:00,753
One!

182
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:04,354
Two!

183
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,671
Three!

184
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:26,803
May the blessings of God be with us.

185
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:30,914
Be careful, remember
your last caper.

186
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:31,951
I will.

187
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:44,014
We've got you!

188
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,244
The real glove is at the Big Dome!

189
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:47,647
Grab her!

190
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:50,089
Did we get her?

191
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:50,994
Sure did!

192
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:52,462
Turn on the lights!

193
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:56,040
What?!?
It's a dummy!

194
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:02,347
Damn! She got past us again!

195
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:05,329
So, it was a trap.

196
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:12,874
Oikawa's glove, huh?
Boy, you're lucky that I'm a big fan.

197
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:15,674
Too bad, you can't have it!

198
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:19,388
Asuka...

199
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:24,665
I have tickets to the Dolphins game.

200
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,938
Takamiya!

201
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:29,347
Will... will you go with me?

202
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,987
Sorry, but I'm already
going with Haneoka.

203
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:47,007
Oh, really? I just hope she
remembers her promise.

204
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:47,681
What?

205
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:52,422
I know who St. Tail is.

206
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:56,672
Shall I tell you?

207
00:14:57,246 --> 00:14:58,406
Oh no!

208
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:10,540
No!

209
00:15:13,148 --> 00:15:14,581
Don't you want to know?

210
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:17,287
I just want to capture her.

211
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,874
I don't care who she is. I just
want to capture her on my own!

212
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:38,855
A breeze?
The dome roof is...!

213
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:51,624
St. Tail!

214
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,224
Good evening!

215
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:56,003
How'd you know we were here?

216
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,536
Never mind that, quickly, arrest her!

217
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,405
And here's the first pitch!

218
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:03,519
It's Show Time!

219
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:04,756
Help!

220
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:07,229
And we're already in the 7th inning.

221
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:20,283
Asuka, do something!

222
00:16:21,264 --> 00:16:22,856
It's out of my hands.

223
00:16:24,004 --> 00:16:26,029
I'm sorry!

224
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:28,105
Oh, be quiet! Stop your bawling.

225
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:31,246
All right, let's end
the game, shall we?

226
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:33,081
One!

227
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:33,680
Two!

228
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:34,520
Three!

229
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:50,653
I'm giving this back
to pitcher Oikawa.

230
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:54,292
You may be his fan,
but taking his glove was wrong!

231
00:16:54,838 --> 00:16:55,566
What?

232
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:58,535
She stole the glove?

233
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:01,015
I'll never do it again.

234
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,981
And I'll take these back, too!

235
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:08,495
Darn.

236
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:11,028
St. Tail! Wait!

237
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:25,627
Goodbye!

238
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:34,248
Thank you, my love.

239
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,874
Man! How many times
do I have to tell you?

240
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:47,207
Listen, meet me at gate #2!

241
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,188
You listen! I don't know
where gate #2 is!

242
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:53,355
I told you, it's the
entrance on the North end!

243
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,634
And which side is North?!

244
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:03,106
Meimi Haneoka,
I'll get you next time.

245
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:08,458
And the championship game between
the Dolphins and the Eagles...

246
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,660
is about to start!

247
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:14,229
On the mound is Oikawa, who hasn't
been doing too well the past few games.

248
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:17,041
Let's see what he has
in store for us today.

249
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:25,533
Steerike!

250
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:29,409
Strike! You're out!

251
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:31,642
What a fastball!

252
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:34,918
Three strikes! Looks like
Oikawa is out of his slump.

253
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:36,549
All right!

254
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:43,071
Oikawa has struck out
three batters in this inning.

255
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:47,307
He's really looking good!

256
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:48,448
Sure is.

257
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:02,272
No! I just want to
capture her on my own!

258
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:07,254
I guess we have to thank St. Tail.

259
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,694
Why are you blushing? Weirdo.

260
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:16,903
You wouldn't understand.
It's very hot.

261
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:19,449
I love you!
