1
00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:08,778
Meimi! Seira!

2
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:13,683
The Tomb Stones are playing
at the Portside Concert Hall!

3
00:00:13,898 --> 00:00:16,458
-Really?
-Tickets go on sale today!

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,503
-What's that?
-You've never heard...

5
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:21,939
...of the Tomb Stones? They're hot!

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,240
Well, I...

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,750
You're so dense about these things.

8
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,426
Come with us!

9
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:37,369
SOLD OUT
ALL TICKETS

10
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:40,341
I see. Thank you, anyway.

11
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:43,812
Too late!

12
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:47,622
They sold out before noon.
We didn't have a chance.

13
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:48,887
Oh, rats.

14
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:52,693
Hey, you girls!
Did you come to buy tickets too?

15
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:54,429
You guys too?

16
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:57,440
Too bad. They're sold out.

17
00:00:57,648 --> 00:00:59,445
What?!

18
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:02,913
She's right!

19
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,753
We should have waited
in line last night!

20
00:01:05,963 --> 00:01:07,954
It's a school day!

21
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,898
-It's only one day!
-What a bunch of kids.

22
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:13,268
Rats! That's not fair!

23
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:16,345
They're making such a fuss.

24
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:21,317
DANGER, DO NOT TOUCH!
SUPER ELECTRIC TRAP

25
00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:27,798
I'm home!

26
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:29,232
Hi, Meimi.

27
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:32,274
Hi, dear. Would you
like some Russian tea?

28
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:34,981
No, maybe later.

29
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:39,753
What's wrong? Why the long face?

30
00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:41,827
Don't worry. I'm fine.

31
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:46,429
You sure? All right.
I'll show you a great trick.

32
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:50,236
It'll put a smile on any sad face.

33
00:01:50,448 --> 00:01:52,245
That'd be terrific.

34
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:02,458
You are now feeling happier.

35
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:08,138
That's right.
So happy you want to sing.

36
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:13,879
Now you feel like laughing.
You're so happy, you want to burst.

37
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:19,894
You want to hug your dad
for making you so happy.

38
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:24,839
I think it's working.
Now for the final touch.

39
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:27,845
-What?
-Here!

40
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:32,312
Tickets to the Tomb Stones concert!
How did you get these?

41
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:39,061
A client gave them to me, but I'm
just not into loud music like that.

42
00:02:39,274 --> 00:02:41,139
I love you, Dad!

43
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:46,681
-They're not good seats, though.
-That doesn't matter! Thanks, Dad!

44
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:48,753
She changes so quickly.

45
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:54,995
Two tickets. Who should I ask?

46
00:02:55,905 --> 00:02:59,500
Seira's not interested
in this sort of thing.

47
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,981
Kyoko and Ryoko would be thrilled,
but they're bound to fight about it.

48
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:10,922
Sure, he would be happy to go...

49
00:03:11,635 --> 00:03:15,366
...but wouldn't it be
sort of like a date?

50
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,819
-Catch you later.
-Right.

51
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:28,656
Good morning!

52
00:03:31,306 --> 00:03:34,332
-Good morning.
-Too bad about yesterday.

53
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:36,912
I was so upset, I couldn't sleep!

54
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:41,144
You liar, we're late because
you overslept today.

55
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,154
I'm missing my chance.

56
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:48,824
-Hey, Emi! Let me see your homework!
-Me too!

57
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,378
Oh, Meimi, it's you.

58
00:03:56,988 --> 00:04:00,321
-What is it?
-Well....

59
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:03,359
If you have something to say, say it.

60
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:05,831
-I have these tickets--
-Asuka!

61
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,469
You're a Tomb Stones fan, right?

62
00:04:08,676 --> 00:04:11,201
Why do you wanna know?

63
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,489
-Tickets to the concert!
-And front row seats too!

64
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:21,823
-How did you get these?
-From my uncle!

65
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:25,471
-No way!
-Hey, let's go together.

66
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:29,405
-How about it?
-Well...

67
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,156
-Well?
-Yeah.

68
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:37,093
What's with her?

69
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:39,559
What's with him?

70
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,081
Meimi!

71
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,620
-What did you want?
-Nothing.

72
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:54,454
Nothing?

73
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:58,532
-You started to say something.
-Forget it.

74
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:00,035
Why the attitude?

75
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:04,178
Rina will get mad if
she catches you talking to me.

76
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,618
She's got nothing to do with this!

77
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:10,383
Well, neither do l!

78
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:12,824
What's with her?

79
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:15,192
What's with him?

80
00:05:21,382 --> 00:05:23,145
May I help you?

81
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:26,614
Forgive me for entering unannounced.

82
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:31,025
That's quite all right.
Do you have a problem?

83
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:40,504
So you're a sculptor.

84
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:44,484
Yes, but I only make metal monuments.

85
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:49,120
Aren't you Daisuke Noguchi?

86
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:52,634
You were given many awards
at one time.

87
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:54,638
Yes, I had it good.

88
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:58,679
But I've been in a slump
for some time now.

89
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:03,882
I was recognized as a real sculptor...

90
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:07,588
...only after I made
the Steel Weathercock.

91
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:12,102
Until then, I borrowed a space
in a workshop and did odd jobs.

92
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:15,746
All I wanted was
to create a masterpiece.

93
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:21,515
But as soon as I unveiled
the weathercock...

94
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:26,530
...my life changed.
All my past hardships like a dream.

95
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:33,737
The Steel Weathercock
was my lucky charm.

96
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:38,980
That's why I wouldn't sell it,
no matter how much anyone offered.

97
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:43,360
But it was stolen a year ago.

98
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:49,043
And I haven't been able
to finish a piece since then.

99
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:53,116
These past six months
have been particularly bad.

100
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:56,223
Then recently I learned
that my sculpture...

101
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:59,591
...is being displayed atop
the Misato building.

102
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:02,292
You must contact the building's owner.

103
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,771
Of course I did that! But...

104
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,653
Please give it back!

105
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:16,387
The weathercock is mine!

106
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:19,894
I believe you are mistaken.

107
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:24,134
I purchased that piece
from a legitimate art dealer.

108
00:07:24,348 --> 00:07:27,806
-That's not possible!
-Hey.

109
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,999
That is the contract.
Well? Now do you understand?

110
00:07:39,644 --> 00:07:43,444
No, these documents aren't real!

111
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:49,486
If you have complaints,
go to the police.

112
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:53,223
But I warn you, I do have
the documents to prove...

113
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:57,429
...I bought the sculpture,
so there's nothing you can do.

114
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,678
Unless, of course,
you offer to buy it back.

115
00:08:01,886 --> 00:08:07,256
However, I have promised to sell it to
a businessman in Hong Kong next week.

116
00:08:07,463 --> 00:08:09,021
So decide quickly.

117
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:12,435
I beg you!
I'm lost without my sculpture!

118
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,170
I must ask you to leave.

119
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:22,120
It's frustrating since
I can't do anything.

120
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:26,385
When will he sell it
to that businessman in Hong Kong?

121
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:31,366
It will be removed three days
from now. I don't know what to do.

122
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,302
And if he gets the sculpture back...

123
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:39,380
...I'm sure he will be able
to create more pieces.

124
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:42,526
But there's not much time left.

125
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:47,298
-Meimi? Meimi!
-Oh, sorry!

126
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:51,738
Are you okay? Since there's
no time, maybe we should reconsider--

127
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:57,477
No! If we forsake a person in trouble,
we'll damage St. Tail's reputation.

128
00:08:57,692 --> 00:09:01,287
I'll get it back for him at any cost!

129
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:06,761
The day after tomorrow.
The same night as the concert.

130
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:10,640
Oh, well.
It won't be fun going alone anyway.

131
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:14,680
I wonder what he'll do.

132
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,587
Will he go to the concert or--?

133
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:23,926
I can't pull a job
without giving him a warning.

134
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:30,144
Good morning!

135
00:09:34,628 --> 00:09:37,563
Asuka!
What time should we meet today?

136
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:41,033
-What are you talking about?
-The concert!

137
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:43,175
Can't you go by yourself?

138
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:47,747
I want you to come with me,
or give me back your ticket!

139
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,614
Hey! Give it back!

140
00:09:52,797 --> 00:09:57,666
I will steal the Steel Weathercock
today from the Misato building.

141
00:09:57,872 --> 00:09:59,669
St. Tail.

142
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:04,745
No, no, no! The concert's today!

143
00:10:04,953 --> 00:10:08,980
Forget about St. Tail!
We're going to the concert!

144
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:29,361
St. Tail, huh?

145
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:32,197
What a bothersome situation.

146
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:35,931
You must do your utmost
to capture her at once.

147
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:39,343
I'm completing the sale
tomorrow afternoon.

148
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,845
How did you come
to own that sculpture?

149
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:46,289
I bought it, of course.
From an art dealer.

150
00:10:46,532 --> 00:10:50,298
St. Tail never steals anything
from its rightful owner.

151
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:54,237
She's just a petty thief,
with no reason for stealing.

152
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,904
Or are you taking her side
on this issue?

153
00:10:58,121 --> 00:11:01,181
Listen, the mayor and I
are close friends.

154
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:04,226
I can easily have you fired.

155
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:09,930
By the way, do you mind
letting me see that sculpture?

156
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,677
By all means. I'll go with you.

157
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:21,092
This isn't good. If St. Tail is
arrested, they'll know we stole it.

158
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:26,030
Not if she can't talk
when she's captured.

159
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:36,386
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

160
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,165
One!

161
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:46,470
Two!

162
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,016
Three!

163
00:12:05,748 --> 00:12:09,309
May the blessings of God be with us.

164
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:12,818
What?

165
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:17,762
For security, a high voltage current
runs through the sculpture.

166
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,838
One touch and you're dead.

167
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:24,743
Even St. Tail can't beat that.

168
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:30,490
You're insane! She'll be--

169
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:34,097
All it means is a foolish
thief was electrocuted.

170
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:35,770
That's murder!

171
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:38,942
No matter. After all,
she is just a thief.

172
00:12:39,145 --> 00:12:43,343
-I won't allow that!
-It's time for you to leave.

173
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,189
What are you doing? Let me go!
Hey, did you hear me?

174
00:12:48,397 --> 00:12:50,661
You won't get away with this!

175
00:12:56,345 --> 00:12:58,472
What's wrong, Asuka Jr.?

176
00:12:58,682 --> 00:13:02,083
They said they don't
need our protection.

177
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:06,555
But I'm not giving up that easy!

178
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:26,393
Funny, no one's around. Maybe
he went to the concert after all.

179
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:32,367
-Don't do anything, you got that?
-Yes, sir.

180
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:47,731
Don't touch it!

181
00:13:57,828 --> 00:14:00,058
It's wired with electricity!

182
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:03,030
That fool! Get them!

183
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:08,944
So that's it! But for now....

184
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,647
Get her!

185
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,758
It's...

186
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:25,169
...showtime!

187
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:41,000
Stop! You won't get away, St. Tail!

188
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:44,512
-Don't let her escape! After her!
-Yes, sir!

189
00:14:49,258 --> 00:14:51,089
Hold it!

190
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:53,093
Over there!

191
00:14:56,973 --> 00:14:58,941
She went into quadrant 24C.

192
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:00,941
Shut her in!

193
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,412
-Who's there?
-Oh, excuse me.

194
00:15:05,623 --> 00:15:10,083
There was no one downstairs,
so I just came on up.

195
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:12,330
You won't get away!

196
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:18,171
Oh, no! I'll be locked in!

197
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,513
Look out!

198
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:31,126
Now!

199
00:15:35,513 --> 00:15:36,775
I made it.

200
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:43,184
Oh, no, I'm trapped!

201
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:48,099
Where is St. Tail?

202
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:51,071
I'm sorry, but she escaped.

203
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:53,772
I believe my son came here.

204
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:58,146
Yes, earlier, but he gave up and left.

205
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,689
-Mr. President--!
-It's okay. He's about to leave.

206
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:08,162
I'll see you later.

207
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,437
Sorry to have bothered you.

208
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:15,510
We've trapped St. Tail.

209
00:16:15,723 --> 00:16:19,454
Turn the cooler on.
Make sure it's on full power.

210
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:23,896
-But Asuka Jr.'s in there too.
-So what?

211
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:33,381
It's freezing!

212
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,754
I'm freezing.

213
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,034
Put this on.

214
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,095
This is for helping me back there.

215
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:46,403
You helped me first, but...

216
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:49,046
Thank you.

217
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,878
-You've got a lot of guts.
-So do you.

218
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,166
There's this really headstrong girl
in my class too.

219
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,101
I don't know why,
but we always end up fighting.

220
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:07,078
I don't mean to, it just happens.
We had a fight today too.

221
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:10,848
-I don't know why, but she was mad.
-You're so dense!

222
00:17:11,528 --> 00:17:14,827
But I could have been
to blame too. Probably.

223
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:20,369
We've got to do something
or we'll freeze!

224
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,037
-Hey, son, you in there?
-Dad?

225
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:28,823
If I can break through that...

226
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:38,910
-Dad!
-I knew you were up to something.

227
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:41,173
So where's St. Tail?

228
00:17:46,194 --> 00:17:47,786
Rats.

229
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:51,331
Stop! Come back here, St. Tail!

230
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:56,999
I'm taking the sculpture! Give
my best to your headstrong friend.

231
00:17:57,215 --> 00:18:00,616
Come back here, you!

232
00:18:02,258 --> 00:18:05,887
Things look bad.
Now that Asuka Jr.'s out...

233
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:09,500
If his father investigates,
we're in trouble.

234
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:12,800
It seems the rumors were true.

235
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,278
Your hobby is
collecting stolen artwork.

236
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,248
That's absurd!

237
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:22,957
You're not being cooperative.

238
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:29,705
My God, look at all this!
These are all listed as stolen.

239
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:33,870
You have quite a collection.
More than rumored!

240
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:35,348
Mr. President.

241
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,549
-Hey, why are you two blushing?
-What do you mean?

242
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:58,284
Never mind that! Where were you
yesterday? I waited all night.

243
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:02,264
Yesterday, St. Tail...

244
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:07,939
Were you two together last night?

245
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,608
Don't be ridiculous!
I wouldn't be caught dead--

246
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:15,725
Hey, that hurts, Meimi!
