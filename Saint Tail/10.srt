1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,797
Good morning!

2
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:08,541
Good morning, Meimi.

3
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:11,513
That was some design contest.

4
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:13,272
You took first place!

5
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:15,376
It was a good design.

6
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:17,212
I know that!

7
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:22,091
It was such a gorgeous dress,
I wish I could wear it!

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,801
I'm sure Miki will let
you if you ask her.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,774
You think so?
Then I'll go ask. Bye!

10
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:33,073
I told you!

11
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,445
I told you I haven't heard anything!

12
00:00:35,554 --> 00:00:37,112
Asuka, wait.

13
00:00:38,357 --> 00:00:39,847
We have a bet, remember?

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,890
A bet?

15
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:50,807
Your part: when you get a challenge
from St. Tail, let me know right away.

16
00:00:51,212 --> 00:00:53,112
Don't try to cheat me!

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,145
I'm not going to cheat!
Geez!

18
00:00:58,223 --> 00:00:59,417
What's going on?

19
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:03,726
Hello.

20
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:15,102
"You Confessed?!"

21
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,145
Good morning.

22
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,720
Good morning. You're looking well.

23
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:25,356
Um, I'm sorry, I
couldn't help overhearing.

24
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:29,297
Do you and Junior have a bet going on?

25
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:32,131
Is it for ice cream?
Or maybe a hamburger?

26
00:01:33,947 --> 00:01:35,107
You really want to know?

27
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,782
At the contest the other day...

28
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:47,863
If Meimi isn't St. Tail,
then I'll stop following her.

29
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:50,967
You promise?

30
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:55,400
But if I'm right, you have to date me.

31
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,277
What?

32
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:58,515
Well?

33
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,310
What's that supposed to mean?

34
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:08,687
Which means, if I prove you
are St. Tail, then I win the bet.

35
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:15,271
I don't give up easily.

36
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,155
In y=-2x+4 reversed,
y equals one hour.

37
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:34,865
Furthermore, in 2x+y=4, x equals...

38
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:36,434
Why?

39
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:39,240
Why'd you make such a bet?

40
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:43,115
Miss Haneoka? Miss Haneoka!

41
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:45,884
Miss Haneoka!

42
00:02:46,262 --> 00:02:47,559
Were you paying attention?!

43
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:50,831
Come here and solve this problem!

44
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:52,635
Yes.

45
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:56,107
That's because
you're always daydreaming.

46
00:02:58,381 --> 00:02:59,643
Stupid!

47
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:02,079
What's with her?

48
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:13,029
I see.

49
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:17,965
And I thought we did such a good job of
fooling Miss Takamiya at the contest.

50
00:03:18,982 --> 00:03:20,779
I just don't understand.

51
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,082
Why'd he make the bet?

52
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:24,217
I...

53
00:03:28,463 --> 00:03:30,863
I certainly don't
want to be caught now!

54
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:33,965
You mean you wanted to at one time?

55
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:35,295
Of course not!

56
00:03:36,476 --> 00:03:37,408
Okay.

57
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:41,171
Recently, a man came
to me seeking help.

58
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:43,517
I didn't know if I should tell you.

59
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:48,420
His name is Mr. Kanamori.

60
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:53,827
His grandfather had
recently passed away...

61
00:03:54,905 --> 00:04:00,172
leaving him a jewel in his will.

62
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:01,340
And then?

63
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:08,946
Then some relatives rewrote the will
and took the jewel from him.

64
00:04:09,762 --> 00:04:11,024
How cruel.

65
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:19,104
They have lied to him,
saying they will put it in safekeeping.

66
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:22,875
But in actuality,
they have put it up for sale.

67
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:30,924
Mr. Kanamori went to see those relatives
to get his jewel back.

68
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:34,797
Uncle, Aunty! I'm begging you!

69
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:37,164
Please, give it back! Please!

70
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:50,779
He desperately wants to get
the jewel before it is sold.

71
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:54,629
I wish I could help,
but Miss Takamiya is...

72
00:04:55,335 --> 00:05:00,602
The way things are going,
she and Asuka will never settle the bet.

73
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:04,941
Because St. Tail won't be caught easily.

74
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:08,452
But then Miss Takamiya
will keep following me.

75
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:11,451
What should I do?!

76
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:13,020
Don't worry.

77
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,834
Leave it to me.

78
00:05:18,272 --> 00:05:20,638
I have an excellent idea.

79
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,334
I'm home!

80
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:41,969
I'm home.

81
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:42,941
Ruby.

82
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:49,949
Are you all right?

83
00:05:51,158 --> 00:05:52,853
Hey, Meimi!

84
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:54,250
Yes?!

85
00:05:54,964 --> 00:05:56,363
What is it, Papa?

86
00:05:56,566 --> 00:06:00,229
You said you like my hands because they
look like a magician's hands, didn't you?

87
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:01,066
Yes.

88
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:03,971
Then... take my hand.

89
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,846
Like this?

90
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:07,145
Yes. And then...

91
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:08,479
I know!

92
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:11,018
You want me to close my eyes,
you've thought up a new trick!

93
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,722
I'll count to three,
then you can open your eyes.

94
00:06:14,328 --> 00:06:15,090
Okay.

95
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:16,729
You ready?

96
00:06:16,832 --> 00:06:17,560
One!

97
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:18,997
Two!

98
00:06:19,436 --> 00:06:20,403
Three!

99
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:26,504
Mama! How'd you do that?

100
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:30,750
This is great!

101
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:34,822
Isn't it? I'm sure this trick will be a hit.

102
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:39,258
This sort of trick
has been done before.

103
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:43,362
But never while holding hands.

104
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:45,002
This is great!

105
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:47,643
Absolutely fantastic!
Show me how to do it!

106
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:48,544
No.

107
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,605
Why not?

108
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:53,813
Because it is the fruit of our labor.

109
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:57,490
You could say it is a symbol of our love.

110
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:05,669
Hey, Dad!

111
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:06,944
Wake up!

112
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,145
I thought you were leaving early!
You're gonna be late!

113
00:07:12,053 --> 00:07:16,080
Jeez. And he just has
to have ham and eggs on Wednesdays.

114
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,951
I will visit Kanamori's house tonight
to steal the jewel.

115
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:43,329
Why's the note burnt?

116
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,028
Cuz it was in my breakfast.

117
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:46,398
Oh, never mind.

118
00:07:46,642 --> 00:07:48,473
I have a great idea.

119
00:07:49,414 --> 00:07:53,350
We lure St. Tail into our trap by
playing on her weakness.

120
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:55,646
You'll help, won't you?

121
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:57,989
I don't know what your plan is.

122
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,519
But I want no part of it if it's sneaky!

123
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:04,901
Oh, all right.
If you won't help, I'll do it myself.

124
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:06,837
But...

125
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:15,141
You do want to settle our bet, don't you?

126
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:17,917
Then don't interfere.

127
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:22,623
Give me your word.

128
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:26,762
This will just be between
St. Tail and me.

129
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:30,143
Have it your way!

130
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,337
Lord forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

131
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:00,650
One!

132
00:09:03,164 --> 00:09:04,153
Two!

133
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:07,995
Three!!

134
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:23,860
Meimi, take this.

135
00:09:25,768 --> 00:09:26,792
What?

136
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:29,835
Did you concoct another of
your strange colognes?

137
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:34,468
It will come in handy tonight.

138
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:42,053
May the blessings of God be with us!

139
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:46,761
No! Never! Absolutely no way!

140
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:50,399
Why do I have to go outside?!

141
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:54,804
You promised, remember?
You said you wouldn't interfere.

142
00:09:56,984 --> 00:09:59,646
You're not going back
on your word, are you?

143
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:04,723
Now Asuka, you wait
outside the room. Hurry up!

144
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,400
Is everything under control?

145
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:13,701
Yes, sir.

146
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:17,107
Shouldn't we guard the inside, too?

147
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:20,279
No, just the outside.
Those are Miss Takamiya's orders.

148
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:26,158
Darn that Takamiya!
She got her nerve, ordering me around!

149
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,983
Okay, he's here alone. He's my target.

150
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,158
Hello.

151
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,665
Sorry, but I need your cooperation.

152
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:01,818
It's so dark.

153
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,524
That must be the heirloom!

154
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:10,900
Strange. Asuka Jr. isn't here.

155
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:20,240
Asuka Jr.!

156
00:11:26,794 --> 00:11:29,058
What happened?!
Who did this to you?!

157
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:37,333
Fooled you, didn't I?
Saint Tail.

158
00:11:38,246 --> 00:11:39,406
Takamiya!

159
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:42,108
Now, let's see your face!

160
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:48,585
Asuka! I know you're here!
We're finally going to see her face!

161
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,170
The switch... is over there!

162
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:59,104
Hurry, turn on the lights!

163
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:07,284
St. Tail is...

164
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,792
One!

165
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,094
Two!

166
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:14,224
Oh no!
You're not getting away!

167
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:16,198
Three!!

168
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:22,005
Asuka, hurry, turn on the lights!

169
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,543
I'm arresting her!

170
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:26,015
Don't interfere!

171
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:39,668
Take a look...

172
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:42,410
this is St. Tail!

173
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:48,516
What went wrong?
I was right, wasn't I?

174
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:50,384
A moustache?

175
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:09,080
A man!

176
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:16,228
St. Tail's... a man?

177
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:21,902
It wasn't Meimi. It's a man.

178
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:22,906
One...

179
00:13:23,113 --> 00:13:23,738
two...

180
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:24,874
three.

181
00:13:29,857 --> 00:13:31,415
I wonder if I overdid it.

182
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:35,226
Sorry, I'm taking this jewel.

183
00:13:54,797 --> 00:13:57,265
I thought I heard St. Tail's voice.

184
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,364
Nah, probably just my imagination.

185
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:18,996
The cat-burglar... I've been
after all this time... is a man.

186
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:21,668
And a transvestite at that.

187
00:14:37,432 --> 00:14:39,366
It can 't be true.

188
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:49,744
"I must speak to you, but you
must promise not to come close to me.

189
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:53,385
Please come to D Park.
-St. Tail."

190
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:56,221
Me?

191
00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:07,570
I really don't want to see that man.
But I guess I'll go see what he has to say.

192
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,997
Good evening!
I'll bet you had quite a shock.

193
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:47,803
You guys were trying to trap me.

194
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,269
That's why you were punished.

195
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,047
Take that!

196
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:55,584
A girl!

197
00:15:58,995 --> 00:16:02,362
If you've had enough, don't try to
discover my identity any further.

198
00:16:04,972 --> 00:16:06,337
Just forget all about it.

199
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:11,145
I know it seemed like
I was in cahoots with Takamiya...

200
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:12,574
but there was nothing I could do.

201
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,645
We had a bet.

202
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:16,154
A bet?

203
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:18,621
Takamiya made this bet.

204
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:20,361
If I won...

205
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:24,862
she promised to stop
following Haneoka around.

206
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:31,646
Haneoka's one of my classmates.

207
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:33,147
Sure, she's kind of noisy...

208
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,712
but I don't think following her
around all the time is right.

209
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:42,294
That's fine.

210
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:46,734
That's not why I'm angry.

211
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:52,300
That's not why I'm angry.

212
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:57,147
I'm gonna arrest her!

213
00:16:59,293 --> 00:17:00,521
That's not...

214
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:04,054
Oh, did you want to be caught?

215
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:06,261
what I meant...

216
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:12,236
I didn't want to be caught by her!

217
00:17:12,546 --> 00:17:14,309
If... If I...

218
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:19,981
If I'm going to be caught by anyone,
I want to be caught by you!

219
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:25,464
That's all.

220
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:26,961
Goodbye!

221
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:34,043
What did she mean by that?

222
00:17:37,987 --> 00:17:38,851
Anyway...

223
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,926
What a relief! St. Tail's a girl!

224
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,063
I'm not telling Takamiya about this.

225
00:18:20,855 --> 00:18:23,119
St. Tail was a man!

226
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,719
Which means I win the bet, Takamiya!

227
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,097
Yes. You're right.

228
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:29,863
You'd better keep your word.

229
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,570
I will.

230
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,069
See you later.

231
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:36,039
Oops!

232
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:42,187
What kind of bet?

233
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:55,105
If I'm going to be caught by anyone,
I want to be caught by you!

234
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:02,619
What's gotten into me?

235
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,949
She's nowhere near here.

236
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,861
None of your business!

237
00:19:11,971 --> 00:19:13,962
You're always so rude!
