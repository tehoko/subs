1
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:04,440
Because I'm your dream girl...?

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,607
If you say it just one more time...

3
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:09,674
I...

4
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:13,683
You resemble...

5
00:00:14,996 --> 00:00:15,963
You...

6
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:19,165
...resemble the girl
I can't stop thinking about!

7
00:00:21,174 --> 00:00:25,736
MOM'S SECRET!
A FEMALE THIEF'S VENGEANCE

8
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,452
You resemble the girl
I can't stop thinking about!

9
00:00:34,764 --> 00:00:36,664
The girl Asuka Jr. likes...

10
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,303
He likes...

11
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:40,632
Meimi!

12
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:44,769
Oh, Meimi! Class is over!

13
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:46,880
You were like that
throughout the class.

14
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:48,179
That's why the Sister was angry...

15
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:50,086
...and gave only you homework.

16
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:51,460
Yeah...

17
00:00:52,897 --> 00:00:53,864
But...

18
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:55,466
...Asuka Jr.'s words...

19
00:00:55,602 --> 00:00:57,399
...keep repeating in my head...

20
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:01,142
I've got an idea! Asuka Jr.!
Why don't you help her?

21
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:03,110
You can finish it
in 15 minutes, can't you?

22
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:10,419
Don't be absurd!

23
00:01:10,562 --> 00:01:12,894
It's worthless
unless you do it by yourself.

24
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:15,095
- Oh, no.
- They're going to start up again.

25
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:17,099
That's all right, Ryoko.

26
00:01:17,274 --> 00:01:18,241
What...?

27
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:19,769
I'll do it by myself.

28
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:21,639
- What..?
- The fight didn't start...?

29
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:27,954
You resemble the girl
I can't stop thinking about!

30
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:30,428
Why did I say that?

31
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:31,589
Asuka Jr.!

32
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:36,931
You know the crown of the sun,
the Prominence Crown, don't you?

33
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:41,136
Yeah. It's showing
at the F Art Museum, isn't it?

34
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:44,142
Don't you think
St. Tail is going to target it?

35
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:47,389
What? What are you
talking about?

36
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:51,963
There's a treasure
lying at the end of the rainbow...

37
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:54,166
What's that?

38
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:57,038
The Prominence Crown
was owned...

39
00:01:57,146 --> 00:01:59,137
...by the Astoria Royal Family.

40
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:00,716
These are the words
from the Royal Family's crest.

41
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:02,353
On this crown...

42
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,015
...there are seven jewels...

43
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,526
...which, people said,
were from the end of a rainbow.

44
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:08,753
Garnet...

45
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:09,934
Topaz...

46
00:02:10,402 --> 00:02:12,529
Emerald and sapphire...

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,335
They are seven colored jewels.

48
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,770
How cool!

49
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:18,646
Only the ruby,
which was in the center,...

50
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:21,283
...has been missing for some time.
It's a famous story.

51
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:23,551
Some say it was stolen.

52
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:25,852
But no one knows
exactly what happened.

53
00:02:26,498 --> 00:02:27,465
However...!

54
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:30,431
The ruby has resurfaced
after over a ten-year absence.

55
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:32,765
I've heard it will go on auction.

56
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:35,704
How would it be possible
for St. Tail to pass it up?

57
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:37,542
I've got the front-page article!

58
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:40,320
You did good research.

59
00:02:40,823 --> 00:02:43,417
I've seen the crown.

60
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,857
Wow! I should go to see it, too!

61
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:46,933
Me, too!

62
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:50,637
Unfortunately St. Tail has
no intention of stealing it!

63
00:02:50,908 --> 00:02:51,875
Sorry!

64
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:55,648
Hello!

65
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:58,415
Meimi's father!

66
00:02:58,723 --> 00:03:01,988
Thank you for being
a good friend to Meimi, Seira.

67
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,220
Not at all. The feeling is mutual.

68
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,027
Today I came here to pray.

69
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:09,230
What?
Is something troubling you?

70
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,308
As a matter of fact...

71
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,847
The other day, all three of us
went to the F Art Museum.

72
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:19,617
But since we saw
the Prominence Crown...

73
00:03:19,726 --> 00:03:23,093
...Eimi, my wife,
has been a little strange.

74
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:25,865
She seems depressed.

75
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:31,138
What can I do to cheer her up?

76
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:32,271
Let's pray!

77
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:35,544
I'm sure God will help us.

78
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:39,355
Thank you, Seira.

79
00:03:46,842 --> 00:03:47,934
I see...

80
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:51,572
As I suspected, since that day
Mom has been depressed...

81
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:53,819
You, too, are depressed...

82
00:03:54,222 --> 00:03:56,213
Your father said so
and is worried about you.

83
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,120
Oh, I'm fine!

84
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,597
See?

85
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:02,627
Enough about me.
I'll ask Mom to her face!

86
00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:03,929
Leave it to me.

87
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:05,908
Meimi...

88
00:04:11,653 --> 00:04:12,620
What?

89
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:14,622
Mom, tell me!

90
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,392
Does the reason
you're depressed...

91
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:19,563
...have anything to do
with the Prominence Crown?

92
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:26,473
Thank you, Meimi.

93
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:27,937
You've noticed it.

94
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:30,118
You're right...

95
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:33,052
Maybe it's about time
for me to talk about it.

96
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:48,151
Meimi.

97
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:50,413
You know I was once
a mysterious thief, don't you?

98
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:51,489
Yes...

99
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:56,154
It was in a town very far from here.

100
00:04:57,402 --> 00:04:59,267
I was called
"Mysterious Thief Lucifer."

101
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:01,799
It meant a devil
that had fallen from the sky.

102
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:12,154
I was a mean thief.

103
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,196
I stole things from innocent
people time after time...

104
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:18,833
...and became
the talk of the town.

105
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:23,105
Did you say you wanted me
to walk in your footsteps?

106
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,543
Oh, no way!

107
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:27,584
The thing I want you to take
is my athletic ability.

108
00:05:28,757 --> 00:05:30,725
You don't do bad things.

109
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:32,594
I know that.

110
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:44,818
Yes...

111
00:05:45,153 --> 00:05:48,987
Originally I started to do it
to test my athletic ability.

112
00:05:50,364 --> 00:05:54,460
But later I discovered
that I couldn't stop being a thief.

113
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,406
For what reason?!

114
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,505
Did you have someone who
pursued you with all of his heart?

115
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:01,479
- What?
- Oh, nothing! Nothing at all!

116
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:10,020
My rival showed up.

117
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,395
I still get irritated
when I think about it!

118
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:17,006
A despicable mysterious
female thief showed up in the town.

119
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:19,970
She enjoyed
doing things for spite.

120
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,914
She targeted whatever item
I was planning to take.

121
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,612
She was like a snake!

122
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:27,383
Oh, Mom.
You're so competitive...!

123
00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:29,563
But one night...

124
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:38,236
...while I was trying to get away
from the police...

125
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:40,214
...I hurt my ankle because of her.

126
00:06:42,223 --> 00:06:44,316
I was in a desperate situation.

127
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:50,629
Then someone hid me
without any questions...

128
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:52,033
It was Dad, wasn't it?!

129
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,108
He was living in a small
apartment and training...

130
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,344
...to be a magician.

131
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,722
I don't have it.
What should I do?

132
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:04,620
I'm poor and I don't
have any medicine.

133
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,195
It hurts, doesn't it?

134
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:07,630
It's none of your business!

135
00:07:07,835 --> 00:07:09,166
But don't make so much noise!

136
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:11,398
If they fiind me, you'll regret it!

137
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:12,669
Oh, I've got an idea!

138
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:14,511
Hey! Are you listening to me?!

139
00:07:15,182 --> 00:07:16,149
One!

140
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:17,218
Two!

141
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,377
Three!

142
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:28,938
I can only do something like that.

143
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,467
But it's good for hiding, isn't it?

144
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:43,865
Since then...

145
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:47,660
Whenever we met,
he gave me an armful of flowers.

146
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:48,874
Only flowers.

147
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:53,577
That's the only magic
he could do at that time.

148
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:10,073
I was happy...

149
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:13,810
...because he always did
all that he could do...

150
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:16,179
...and he tried to make me happy.

151
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:18,151
When I watched him like that...

152
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:20,323
...I started to think...

153
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:23,262
...of the stupid things
I had been doing.

154
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:26,707
And I stopped being a thief.

155
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:39,992
I planned on returning
all of the things I had stolen...

156
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:42,732
...to their rightful owners.

157
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:45,739
At least I was planning to do so...

158
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:47,612
But...

159
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:51,548
...the one thing I couldn't return
was the Prominence Crown's ruby.

160
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:55,992
On the way to return it,
that other woman took it from me.

161
00:08:57,732 --> 00:08:58,892
And that's how it ended.

162
00:08:59,803 --> 00:09:01,270
When I saw the crown...

163
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,197
...I remembered it.

164
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,209
Cheer up, Mom!

165
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,008
I'm not going to tell Dad.

166
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:12,688
Dad knows everything.

167
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:15,959
As always
he doesn't mention it to me.

168
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:30,080
Seira. I'm going
to get the Crown's ruby back.

169
00:09:30,491 --> 00:09:32,584
The auction place is...

170
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:33,855
...the same place as before.

171
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:36,191
So this time...

172
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,098
...I don't think
you should go there.

173
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:39,764
Besides, I'm sure Asuka has...

174
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:41,739
...all of the information
about the place...

175
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:43,946
I've found the warehouse...

176
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:47,276
...where they're keeping
the ruby until the auction.

177
00:10:01,112 --> 00:10:02,079
One!

178
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:03,716
Two!

179
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:05,574
Three!

180
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,748
"Tomorrow night,
I'm going to the R Warehouse...

181
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,691
...to take the 'Star Ruby.'

182
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:11,963
-St. Tail"

183
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:13,656
St. Tail?

184
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:15,535
As expected, she's coming!

185
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,537
Asuka Jr. is
in love with someone...

186
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:24,985
What should I do, Mom?

187
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,662
You haven't gone home yet?

188
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,788
Neither have you.

189
00:10:35,908 --> 00:10:38,138
Excuse me, you two!

190
00:10:44,657 --> 00:10:49,560
Hello! I've just opened
a fortune telling shop near this school.

191
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:51,928
Please come by
with your boyfriend.

192
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:55,697
Oh, my...!

193
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:59,111
How cute! You're blushing!

194
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:03,579
Hello there! I've just opened
a fortune telling shop...

195
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,854
Please come!
I'll be expecting you!

196
00:11:06,162 --> 00:11:08,130
Hello, over there!

197
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:11,429
I guess it's better
if you're not seen with me.

198
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,101
I've never said that!

199
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:26,521
This is for your homework.

200
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:29,192
You can peek
only if you can't figure it out.

201
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:33,176
Thank you.

202
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:36,541
I didn't do it for your sake.

203
00:11:37,552 --> 00:11:38,780
Practice... practice.

204
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,779
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

205
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:01,026
One!

206
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:04,465
Two!

207
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:09,398
Three!

208
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,368
Good luck, Meimi!

209
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:27,902
You can leave it to me!
It's for my dad and mom!

210
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,311
May the blessings
of God be with us.

211
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,050
There it is!

212
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:53,481
That must be the Star Ruby.

213
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:56,117
Where is Asuka Jr.?

214
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,955
Today is the day I'll catch her!

215
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,159
One!

216
00:13:03,272 --> 00:13:04,239
Two!

217
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:05,535
Three!

218
00:13:09,683 --> 00:13:10,672
Wait...

219
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:12,578
It's too easy...

220
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:14,023
Where is the security?

221
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:21,065
The owner of the jewel...

222
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:23,463
...refused the security
in the warehouse.

223
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,176
Are they outside?

224
00:13:35,563 --> 00:13:36,621
I've got her!

225
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:38,498
You won't escape today!

226
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:39,602
One!

227
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:40,671
Two!

228
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:41,862
Three!

229
00:13:44,646 --> 00:13:48,639
I'm sorry, but you're the last
person I want to catch me!

230
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:01,274
At last I've found you!

231
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:06,981
We've put the Star Ruby
on auction to draw you out.

232
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:09,114
The Mysterious Thief Lucifer...

233
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:10,685
We've discovered
the clue to finding you.

234
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,391
You're the last person
I want to catch me!

235
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,177
I wonder...

236
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,678
I wonder why I want to catch her.

237
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:47,286
At first, I just wanted to catch her...

238
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:51,056
When you showed up,
I was excited.

239
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:52,922
But then...

240
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:55,598
...I didn't want
anyone else to have you!

241
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:05,586
From that moment on...

242
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:57,713
There's a treasure lying
at the end of the rainbow...

243
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:02,087
I don't remember
which royal family it was...

244
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:04,766
...but the end of the rainbow
can't exist physically...

245
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:06,767
Oh, shoot! I'll be late for school!

246
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:54,658
At the end of the rainbow...

247
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:56,653
...is a treasure...

248
00:18:01,772 --> 00:18:02,830
Asuka Jr.!

249
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:05,969
Don't tell me he spent
the whole night in the rain?

250
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,044
What's the matter?!

251
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,716
What about you?
It's pretty early...

252
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,689
I'm on duty this morning.

253
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:14,995
What happened to you?

254
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:29,847
You've got a high fever!

255
00:18:30,224 --> 00:18:32,715
Wait a minute!
I'll call your home.

256
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:33,884
I love you...

257
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:37,064
I love you, Meimi.

258
00:18:38,506 --> 00:18:39,530
It's the truth.

259
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,077
I'm happy...

260
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,080
...that you're here with me...

261
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:55,628
I AM RETURNING THIS.
-ST. TAIL

262
00:18:57,473 --> 00:18:58,735
...that my hand...

263
00:18:58,975 --> 00:18:59,964
...can reach you...
