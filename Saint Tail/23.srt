1
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:44,156
UNFORGIVABLE!
THE BAD GUYS DESTROY A HOUSE

2
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:53,072
-Good morning!
-Good morning, Meimi!

3
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,289
Hey, Meimi, look at this!

4
00:00:56,526 --> 00:00:58,426
This brings back memories.

5
00:00:58,663 --> 00:01:01,791
Isn't this a Miho-chan doll?
I had one like this.

6
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:07,805
I found it cleaning my room. It brought
back memories so I brought it with me.

7
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:11,916
I wonder if I still have mine.
I'll try looking for it.

8
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:17,788
We girls have a lot of memories
in these dolls, don't we?

9
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:21,802
You girls are lucky to have
that much time on your hands.

10
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:24,477
I don't even have time
to make memories.

11
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:29,277
I'm so busy trying
to catch St. Tail that...

12
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:35,123
Right. With all those memories of
St. Tail escaping, you're frustrated.

13
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:37,227
What's that?

14
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:40,909
If you don't like it,
try catching her quickly.

15
00:01:41,148 --> 00:01:45,847
It'll be your most precious memory.
Though it's probably impossible.

16
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:51,124
Now you've said it! I'm not after
St. Tail for a reason like that!

17
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:54,496
Precious memories, what nonsense!

18
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:59,769
Is that so? Are you saying there are
no memories between you and St. Tail?

19
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,245
Why are you so upset?

20
00:02:03,492 --> 00:02:06,825
-How should I know?
-My doll...

21
00:02:09,604 --> 00:02:12,801
It disgusts me to know
what a dingbat that guy is!

22
00:02:13,545 --> 00:02:17,743
Oh, my. We should be
the ones appreciating him.

23
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:23,015
Why is that?
He's never done anything to save--

24
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:26,861
That's not true, is it?

25
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,973
When you're angry, Meimi,
it's usually about Asuka Jr.

26
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:33,147
Seira, you're mean!

27
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:38,048
Anyway, today there was another
lost sheep that wandered by here.

28
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:41,990
A while ago, Michiru came by
to ask for help.

29
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:46,467
She used to live happily
in a mansion with her parents.

30
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:52,210
But one year ago, Michiru's father
co-signed a loan for a friend...

31
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:56,392
...and because of that,
they lost their mansion.

32
00:02:57,265 --> 00:03:00,701
That friend he co-signed for...

33
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:04,340
...took the loan money
and disappeared.

34
00:03:05,147 --> 00:03:09,481
Not only did the loan company
take control of the mansion...

35
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,317
...but everything inside
of it as well.

36
00:03:13,397 --> 00:03:16,457
Michiru's jewelry box
was a precious thing...

37
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:19,264
...filled with all kinds of memories.

38
00:03:19,977 --> 00:03:23,310
Michiru hid the box in the house.

39
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:28,648
Right after that, they were forced
to vacate the property.

40
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:33,354
Then that jewelry box is
still hidden in the house.

41
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,568
She was planning to get it back later.

42
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:40,838
But Negoro, who owns
the loan company...

43
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:50,297
It's you again. You'll get nowhere,
no matter how many times you come.

44
00:03:50,537 --> 00:03:52,698
Just for a little while.

45
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:56,434
I want to see the inside
of the house one more time.

46
00:03:56,683 --> 00:04:01,677
This house doesn't belong to you
anymore, young lady. It's mine.

47
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:05,992
Also, this land is being sold...

48
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:10,365
...so we're gonna have
to tear down the house.

49
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:16,076
What will happen to her memories?
The jewelry box of memories?!

50
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:22,054
There's nothing that can be done
about Michiru's house being torn down.

51
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:27,004
Then at least the jewelry box
should be returned to Michiru.

52
00:04:27,845 --> 00:04:29,938
If it isn't, it'll be too sad.

53
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:34,482
Ever since the house was taken,
Michiru's mother has become ill.

54
00:04:35,794 --> 00:04:38,524
They're breaking down
the house tomorrow.

55
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:40,928
We only have tonight
to carry this out.

56
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:43,772
Let's get those memories back!

57
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,619
What's this?

58
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:01,873
Is this a--?

59
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,249
"Tonight, I'll be entering
the Misaki mansion...

60
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:07,954
...to pick up a jewelry box.
-St. Tail"

61
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:10,490
It's a notice from St. Tail!

62
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,699
-A notice from St. Tail?
-Where is it?

63
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:17,633
Don't push. I can't see it!

64
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,388
So that's the Misaki mansion.

65
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,135
What's happening?

66
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:39,773
-I'll leave tomorrow up to you.
-I understand.

67
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:51,295
This is really troublesome, isn't it?
Tearing down a mansion like this.

68
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:56,345
Making this an open lot is the terms
the buyer made. What can I say?

69
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:58,555
It'll all be done by tomorrow.

70
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,487
We're finally getting to the cash.

71
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:07,327
Didn't think that it'd go this smooth.
Like a bubble on a wet hand.

72
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:11,774
Nobody would suspect that
you borrowed the money and I lent it.

73
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:14,850
Not realizing a thing...

74
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,652
...your co-signer Misaki is
either a real nice guy or an idiot.

75
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:25,634
-Oh, how my heart aches.
-That guy picked a bad friend.

76
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,939
-Speak for yourself.
-Excuse me.

77
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:30,846
Who are you?

78
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:36,493
Mr. Negoro? I'm Asuka Jr. I'm assisting
in the St. Tail investigations.

79
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:38,628
St. Tail?

80
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:42,773
Actually, we just received
a notice from her.

81
00:06:43,013 --> 00:06:47,211
She's going to appear here tonight
to steal a jewelry box.

82
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:50,484
A jewelry box? Impossible!

83
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:54,527
How could there be such a thing
in this unoccupied mansion?

84
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:56,964
By the way, what's that for?

85
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:59,607
Tomorrow we're clearing this lot.

86
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:02,370
You're going to tear it down.

87
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,388
If St. Tail is coming, there will
be a horde of cops here too!

88
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:12,863
I know.
Anyway, you'd better disappear.

89
00:07:13,106 --> 00:07:16,337
But is there really
a jewelry box in there?

90
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:21,607
I got everything in there out.
There shouldn't be anything left.

91
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:24,484
Something's fishy.

92
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:28,324
St. Tail wouldn't come to steal
something that's not there.

93
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:31,298
Could she have uncovered our scheme?

94
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:36,275
And the proof is hidden in this
mansion? And she's coming to steal it.

95
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:43,651
St. Tail has caused many criminals
to be arrested.

96
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:48,064
Maybe we should clear
the lot off tonight.

97
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:51,835
Whatever St. Tail is up to,
if there's no place here...

98
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,415
...there's nothing to worry about.

99
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:58,723
If the mansion isn't here,
there's nothing that can be done.

100
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:02,990
Since it's been decided,
let's tear it down right away!

101
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:05,036
Here it is!

102
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,744
It's a woman!

103
00:08:07,981 --> 00:08:10,677
Hey, look at this!

104
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,855
What's all the panic about?

105
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,756
Look! Doesn't this
bring back memories?

106
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:20,229
It's the Miho-chan doll
that you bought for me.

107
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:21,997
I remember!

108
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:27,112
I bought it for your fifth birthday.
You've had it all these years.

109
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:30,720
This doll was so very precious
to you, Meimi.

110
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,294
You didn't want any doll
other than this Miho-chan.

111
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:39,836
Papa, can you make this doll
new again with your magic?

112
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:45,083
Well, let's see. I wonder if I can.

113
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:51,052
But your precious memories
may disappear too, Meimi.

114
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,903
Well, I'll keep it the way it is.

115
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,607
Here.

116
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:09,022
I'm sorry, I've got to go to work.

117
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:13,535
So please entertain our guest.

118
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,527
You're joking!
I can't let you do that!

119
00:09:28,006 --> 00:09:32,534
Why? We've got to complete
the clearing of the lot by tonight.

120
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,613
Get out of the way.

121
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:37,720
You said it'd be done tomorrow,
didn't you?

122
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:39,722
The plans have changed.

123
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:43,626
St. Tail's coming!
There's no time for that!

124
00:09:44,138 --> 00:09:47,232
She can take anything she wants.

125
00:09:47,478 --> 00:09:50,538
What could be
in an empty house anyway?

126
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:54,050
A jewelry box. I understand.

127
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:59,559
Then please let us check if there
is really a jewelry box in there.

128
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:02,128
There isn't one.

129
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:05,810
Well, if it's not there,
I'm clearing the place.

130
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:10,015
But should we find one,
you'll have to leave things to us.

131
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:12,817
If stolen things are in there...

132
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:17,124
...we have an obligation
to protect them from St. Tail!

133
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:20,198
You won't find one.

134
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,322
Oh, Lord, forgive me,
for I use no gimmick or trick.

135
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,109
One!

136
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:43,347
Two!

137
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:47,688
Three!

138
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:03,789
St. Tail, hurry.

139
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:09,024
I don't know why, but they're
planning to clear the lot tonight.

140
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:11,640
You're kidding! But why?

141
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,213
I've checked up a bit
on that loan company...

142
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:18,889
...and it seems to be a little shady.

143
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:22,085
Meimi, be very careful.

144
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,301
Don't worry. I'll be back
with Michiru's box of memories.

145
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,306
May the blessings of God be with us.

146
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:37,554
Please let me get there in time!

147
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:45,141
Well? There's nothing here, is there?

148
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:02,639
Now, are you satisfied?
St. Tail has probably made a mistake.

149
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,976
I'll be keeping you to your promise
and start clearing the lot.

150
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:09,681
I haven't said it's not here yet!

151
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:14,095
A promise is a promise.
I won't stand for this any longer.

152
00:12:14,336 --> 00:12:16,896
The work is going to be started.

153
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:19,408
Even if I stay?

154
00:12:19,646 --> 00:12:22,114
You should be careful
of the chandelier.

155
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:25,617
It'll probably come falling
with the tremor.

156
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:33,300
What a stubborn idiot!

157
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:41,943
Stop it! Stop it right now!

158
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:43,658
What a pesky brat!

159
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:48,333
What do you think you're doing?

160
00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:50,869
It's St. Tail!

161
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:58,543
Everyone! Get to your positions!

162
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:10,270
That's St. Tail!

163
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:14,211
Knock her down with the bulldozer!
Never mind! I'll do it myself!

164
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:19,457
How terrible can he get?

165
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:25,808
Stop it!

166
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,193
Darn! Quit scampering around!

167
00:13:51,027 --> 00:13:54,019
After her!
St. Tail has entered the mansion!

168
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:01,975
Darn it!

169
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,449
Hold it!

170
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:19,672
It can't be.
I'm sure it was this room.

171
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:35,168
St. Tail, you're in full view.

172
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:40,657
Give yourself up, St. Tail!

173
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:44,158
It's unforgivable
to take someone's memories!

174
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:57,448
I've got you cornered, St. Tail!

175
00:14:57,693 --> 00:14:59,593
You! Come here!

176
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:08,009
Wait a minute!
What are you guys doing?

177
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:12,946
With all this weight,
the chandelier is gonna fall!

178
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,496
There!

179
00:15:30,258 --> 00:15:32,818
That's where it was?

180
00:15:33,397 --> 00:15:37,458
St. Tail, I'll have you
show me your identity!

181
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,680
That idiot! At a time like this!

182
00:15:45,922 --> 00:15:47,082
Unforgivable!

183
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:56,394
If I get rid of this mansion,
there's nothing St. Tail can do!

184
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:03,276
What?

185
00:16:05,093 --> 00:16:08,153
I won't let you destroy any more!

186
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:14,768
It's...

187
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:17,809
...Show...

188
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,883
...Time!

189
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:24,725
You pesky worm!

190
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:45,131
Exactly what I was worried about.
He's getting licked! Darn!

191
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:54,847
Goodbye. And I've got
the jewelry box of memories.

192
00:16:55,694 --> 00:16:56,854
Memories?

193
00:16:57,297 --> 00:17:00,630
What do you mean, memories, St. Tail?

194
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:05,740
Hey, what are you doing here?
Hold it right there!

195
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:15,059
-And where are you going?
-Well...

196
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,897
-Hey, son!
-Dad? Why are you here?

197
00:17:21,144 --> 00:17:24,671
I had business with these two.
Negoro and Momochi.

198
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,013
-You're under arrest for fraud.
-Fraud?

199
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:31,284
These two are convicted criminals.

200
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:34,432
We already know
that you two teamed up...

201
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:38,004
...to swindle this mansion
from Mr. Misaki. Give up!

202
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:39,773
Darn it!

203
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:55,907
-Mother, here, some water.
-Thank you.

204
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:07,798
I'm home!

205
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:14,203
Father, my treasure box has come back!
My precious memories are back!

206
00:18:19,827 --> 00:18:23,729
I'm glad! Then Michiru's able
to return to that house.

207
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:28,000
Yes. It's only natural because
those two have been caught.

208
00:18:28,244 --> 00:18:30,712
But the house has
been damaged so much.

209
00:18:31,383 --> 00:18:35,149
Don't worry.
The memories haven't been damaged!

210
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:49,879
What is it?

211
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:53,720
I've heard that you've made
a few more memories.

212
00:18:53,961 --> 00:18:58,591
Memories! Quit bugging me about them!
You act just like someone I know.

213
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:00,840
Someone you know?

214
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:05,808
Well, who was it?

215
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:10,419
Oh, forget it!
It's none of your concern!
