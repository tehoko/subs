1
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,890
Will the bus return here after two hours?

2
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:30,791
The time has passed!

3
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,156
If you walk in this way you
will find a village nearby.

4
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:35,705
I know that.

5
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:37,478
I know that very well!

6
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:38,183
Hm?

7
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,675
I think I missed you very much...

8
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:51,720
Here is my hometown...

9
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,280
I WANT TO SEE MY GRANDMOTHER

10
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:02,112
Stop making this funny sound!
What do you want?

11
00:02:02,386 --> 00:02:06,979
But I apologize for leaving
and forgetting our past days!

12
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:07,711
Oh!

13
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:09,570
<i>Leave immediately!</i>

14
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:11,859
I don't want to see your face!

15
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:23,418
Excuse me!

16
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:24,859
Grandma Forrest!

17
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,523
What's the matter, Jon Carraclough?

18
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,297
Have you been throughout the day
when the teacher Curry?

19
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:31,586
Y-yes...

20
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:35,265
<i>It's your fault because you read
the book until late at night!</i>

21
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:38,158
That is why you overslept!

22
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:41,917
Grandma Forrest knows everything.

23
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:46,087
She looks from that window all the time so
she knows all the news of the village!

24
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,280
John, you're late!

25
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,425
Sorry! Sorry!

26
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,830
I just saw something very strange!

27
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:52,322
Eh?

28
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:53,134
Very strange?

29
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:54,017
Yes.

30
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,915
Grandma Forest act like I have
never seen her before!

31
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,462
She seemed to be arguing with someone.

32
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:00,510
She argued?

33
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,454
You mean Grandma Forrest?

34
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,930
She poured water on him
from the second floor...

35
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:09,128
<i>It was a warm welcome!</i>

36
00:03:09,228 --> 00:03:10,670
Well, it's inevitable.

37
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:13,134
Because you left the village 20 years ago.

38
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:16,671
It's your fault because you
never communicated with her.

39
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,523
Yes, thank you for this.

40
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:19,194
Okay.

41
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:22,069
Twenty years...

42
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:24,890
For me it was short...

43
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,610
In the meantime, I never thought of returning.

44
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:29,726
Yes.

45
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:33,860
In any case, I can't forgive such a thing.

46
00:03:33,976 --> 00:03:35,200
Are you going back already?

47
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:38,022
I have to go back for work.

48
00:03:38,756 --> 00:03:42,833
Over time she will actually listen to me.

49
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,545
Until my mother forgives me
I will go to rest in the monastery!

50
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,503
See you!

51
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:48,169
Okay!

52
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,481
"Mom"?

53
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,880
<i>Uncle!</i>

54
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:56,700
I saw this guy in front of
Grandma Forest's house, though...

55
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,615
Yes!

56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,700
He's Grandma Forest's son.

57
00:03:59,787 --> 00:04:00,545
- Eh?
- Eh?

58
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:01,930
Grandma Forrest?

59
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:02,981
Her son?

60
00:04:03,052 --> 00:04:03,675
Yes.

61
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:07,746
But Grandma Forest said:
"I don't want to see your face!"

62
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,550
Albert left the house after
arguing with his parents.

63
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,676
That's why he left this village

64
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:15,051
He argued with them?

65
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,191
He doesn't seem to work today either.

66
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:53,320
I wonder why Grandma Forest doesn't let him in?

67
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,655
Even though he is her son.

68
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,827
Right!

69
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:57,788
Something might have happened!

70
00:04:58,109 --> 00:05:00,578
The son of Mrs. Forest left

71
00:05:00,772 --> 00:05:05,150
before your father came to this village so
we can't anticipate the circumstances.

72
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:07,759
But whatever the circumstances,

73
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:11,126
he still wants to see Grandma!

74
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:11,796
Hm?

75
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:12,770
Why?

76
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:14,200
Well, isn't it?

77
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:16,126
Isn't this what a family does?

78
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,922
Yes, that's right!

79
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:22,700
John, it certainly does, but there are
many circumstances in this world.

80
00:05:22,813 --> 00:05:25,890
But, is definitely a parent
I would like to see!

81
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:27,758
Dad, isn't that true?

82
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:28,438
Oh...

83
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:29,798
Hm...!

84
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:31,149
This is true...

85
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,690
Oh my God, my God!

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,686
Oh... Where are you going on your holiday?

87
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:37,485
Hm?

88
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:41,532
I'll have a short talk with Mrs. Forrest.

89
00:05:48,518 --> 00:05:51,255
<i>What do you mean by living together?</i>

90
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:53,524
So cruel!

91
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:56,056
<i>Mrs. Forrest, just a moment!</i>

92
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,789
What? Sam Carraclough?

93
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:00,986
You came for me?

94
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:02,095
Don't say that!

95
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:06,423
Weren't you watching the latest thing?

96
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:10,259
Can I come in for a moment?

97
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:16,212
<i>What is this...?</i>

98
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,993
So you can open the door.

99
00:06:19,157 --> 00:06:23,353
<i>Enter quickly and close the door
so no stranger enters here!</i>

100
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,865
<i>Regardless of that...</i>

101
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:31,434
Isn't that strange man your son?

102
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,570
My son, you said?

103
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:33,349
Yes!

104
00:06:33,474 --> 00:06:34,880
Sam Carraclough!

105
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:35,522
Yes!

106
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,010
I don't have any son!

107
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:42,582
My only family is my late husband George!

108
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:44,692
No, I mean...

109
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:45,850
Hm!

110
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:50,154
I told you that I don't have any sons!

111
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:54,223
No way, Mrs. Forrest!

112
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,701
F-father?

113
00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:57,598
John!

114
00:06:57,623 --> 00:06:59,704
Dr. Hooper, call him quickly!

115
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:00,884
Y--yes!

116
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:10,890
Well... It has little blood pressure only!

117
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,873
It's best to be not very active.

118
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:18,474
<i>I'm back!</i>

119
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,210
How are you?

120
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:20,941
Ah...

121
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:23,063
Will my grandmother come to our house?

122
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:23,701
Oh?

123
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:27,630
No... it seems she doesn't want to forgive me.

124
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,965
She was very stubborn.

125
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,138
Is that so?

126
00:07:32,498 --> 00:07:38,263
In this picture looks like a very nice grandma.

127
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,466
So, I will leave your present here!

128
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:44,662
<i>John Carraclough!</i>

129
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:48,013
There's no need to treat me as a patient!

130
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:51,474
Aren't you late for the kite?

131
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:52,225
Oh?

132
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:54,685
Do I have to do it, grandmother?

133
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,670
Are you still standing here?

134
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:58,980
And now, go!

135
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:00,130
Yes, see you!

136
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,966
Won't you go with him, Lassie?

137
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:14,138
I always look at this part of the city.

138
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,044
Look!

139
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,466
Duhan is here much as it is now.

140
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,974
He thinks something good has happened to him!

141
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,535
This is Sam Carraclough's house.

142
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,975
I still remember the first day
we met in this village.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,810
He was still young and went to school.

144
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,250
And the day when John got you,
you were a puppy, Lassie!

145
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:42,698
Hm?

146
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:43,938
And this?

147
00:08:43,963 --> 00:08:47,331
This is an old picture of our family.

148
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:48,971
<i>This is me!</i>

149
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:52,635
That's my late husband George,
and this kid...

150
00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:56,635
It was a beautiful day...

151
00:08:58,253 --> 00:09:00,362
I wonder how things

152
00:09:00,387 --> 00:09:03,855
got even bigger until they became like this?

153
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,740
In the end he left the house
and lived freely elsewhere.

154
00:09:09,534 --> 00:09:13,104
George was working hard

155
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:17,948
to make money for my son Albert.

156
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:22,112
But that boy stole the golden piece!

157
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:23,347
Hm!

158
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:26,440
Then I didn't know how he lives
and where he was.

159
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:30,088
Even when his father died, he never came!

160
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,081
And when he understood his sin
he came after he left this village

161
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,425
to ask me to live with him!

162
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:39,460
Don't be silly!

163
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,429
<i>You bastard!</i>

164
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:48,444
<i>Whoa!</i>

165
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,866
It flew!

166
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,430
You are late, Lassie!

167
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,020
Have you been to Grandma Forest all the time?

168
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,960
And Grandma Forrest's son?

169
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:02,360
Eh? Lassie, did you know
that about grandmother?

170
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:09,410
What's up, Lassie?

171
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:12,127
Ah, someone is sitting there!

172
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:13,425
<i>I wonder who is it?</i>

173
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,902
<i>Sorry...</i>

174
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:18,512
Hm?

175
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,885
What is the matter?

176
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,135
Are you hurt?

177
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,160
Hurt? You are wrong!

178
00:10:23,277 --> 00:10:27,460
I just lost something very precious!

179
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:29,089
Very precious?

180
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:32,480
Yes, it's a necklace I got from my father!

181
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:33,933
A necklace?

182
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:37,441
It's very precious for my father!

183
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:42,401
Ah, there it is!

184
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,820
I'm happy, thank you!

185
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:47,386
Tell me, we have met you
but we haven't asked who you are!

186
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,807
Yes, me?

187
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:51,350
I'm Roy George Forest!

188
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:52,460
Forrest?

189
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:55,200
Oh, could he be...

190
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:57,270
Grandma Forrest's grandson?

191
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:58,167
Hm?

192
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,979
Do you know my grandmother?

193
00:11:06,253 --> 00:11:08,237
We really know her...

194
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:08,947
Yes...

195
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:14,100
We know her, yet we didn't know
anything about grandmother's grandson!

196
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,651
I didn't know, it was a novelty.

197
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:19,339
Hm...

198
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:20,667
That's true!

199
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,746
I also didn't know

200
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:24,725
about having a grandmother...

201
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,435
Eh?

202
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:26,535
Hm...

203
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,348
If you don't know anything
about your grandmother

204
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:32,403
it means that you are
very terrible and stubborn...

205
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:33,107
Ouch!

206
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:35,372
Stop it! This is rude!

207
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:37,583
Ah... right... sorry!

208
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,860
That's okay!

209
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,297
My father is the one who
oppressed my grandmother.

210
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,656
That's why I wanted to see my grandmother,

211
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:48,805
but that's impossible.

212
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:52,797
I have an old picture of my grandmother!

213
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,750
She looks very nice and she smiles!

214
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,391
- Eh?
- Eh?

215
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,820
I looked at the picture a lot.

216
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,450
That's why I wanted to see my grandmother.

217
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,985
<i>Also...</i>

218
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:04,063
Also?

219
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,969
I haven't told my father and mother
about coming here...

220
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:10,274
...alone!

221
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,608
So let's go, quickly!

222
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,742
I'll tell you about your grandmother's place!

223
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,368
Yes!

224
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:25,836
<i>Mom!</i>

225
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:26,540
- Oh!
- Oh!

226
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,305
<i>My son and his mother want to see you!</i>

227
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,063
He's your grandson, Mom!

228
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:34,805
Mom, you want to see him, don't you?

229
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,403
<i>My grandson?</i>

230
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,613
<i>My only family is my late husband George!</i>

231
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:42,450
<i>I don't have any children!</i>

232
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:45,620
<i>I don't have any child, I mean
I don't have any grandson!</i>

233
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:48,880
<i>How should I meet strangers?</i>

234
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,675
<i>But Mom...</i>

235
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:50,909
<i>Leave!</i>

236
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,930
<i>If you don't leave, I will pour water on you!</i>

237
00:12:54,027 --> 00:12:54,738
Oh...

238
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,440
Grandmother... don't want to see me...

239
00:13:03,518 --> 00:13:04,979
It's not true!

240
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,010
That's right!

241
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:06,636
Yes!

242
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:10,057
She wants to see you, Roy.

243
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,128
But she's a little stubborn.

244
00:13:12,237 --> 00:13:14,815
I think she doesn't want to say
that she really wants to see you.

245
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:15,816
Yes...

246
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,510
Can't we do anything?

247
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:19,605
Hm...

248
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:20,964
<i>Listen John...</i>

249
00:13:21,113 --> 00:13:21,675
Yes...

250
00:13:21,753 --> 00:13:23,151
This is true...

251
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,800
I can't believe my mother is so stubborn!

252
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,581
What? Do you want to cry?

253
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,885
No way!

254
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:33,003
Since I left this village

255
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:37,338
I went to many places and
started building my own life.

256
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,784
In the end I stayed in a house of my own.

257
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:42,893
And so I can welcome her!

258
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:45,018
That's what I was thinking about.

259
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:48,020
It took me 20 years to think about it.

260
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:49,091
She's 20 years older!

261
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,717
Ah-ah...

262
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:54,787
I can't give up easily.

263
00:13:54,888 --> 00:14:00,940
You can't do that easily after
you decided to leave the village!

264
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,873
Damn!

265
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:04,980
I don't know if I inherited this
from my mother or not.

266
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:06,732
<i>My grandson?</i>

267
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:07,959
Hm!

268
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:09,349
Hm?

269
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,529
What brings you to my home, John Carraclough?

270
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:13,256
E-e-eh...

271
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,521
I brought some cookies with me,
I want to have tea with you, Grandma!

272
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:20,910
I wonder what wind carry you?

273
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,209
Well okay, come in!

274
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:30,279
Today I haven't come alone,
is it okay if my cousin comes with me?

275
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,404
Ah!

276
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:32,904
This face...

277
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,185
<i>Albert! It's not possible...</i>

278
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,130
Now, are you ready?

279
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,552
I don't want to meet her as her grandson.

280
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,090
If I tell her that I'm her grandson,
she'll throw me out.

281
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,420
I'm sure you'll be fine!

282
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:52,584
Well, is it okay to have tea here sometimes?

283
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:53,772
Hm!

284
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:55,935
<i>My grandmother...</i>

285
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,146
Your cousin, John Carraclough?

286
00:14:59,762 --> 00:15:02,475
The person that's with you doesn't seem to be.

287
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,355
Really?

288
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,037
Today he came to visit me in my house!

289
00:15:06,062 --> 00:15:06,691
Hm!

290
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:09,900
I didn't know that you have a cousin!

291
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,865
Really? But it's true!

292
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:13,326
<i>John...!</i>

293
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:14,730
John!

294
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:17,005
Aren't you here? You're away?

295
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,465
They're calling you, John Carraclough!

296
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,201
Now answer them immediately!

297
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,301
Yes, I'll go at them for a moment!

298
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:25,951
Roy, pour tea for grandmother!

299
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:27,248
Oh... oh!

300
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,623
Wait a moment!

301
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:31,076
I can't, Sandy calls me!

302
00:15:31,153 --> 00:15:31,903
See you!

303
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,880
You can go with him quickly!

304
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:40,052
No, I will give you tea.

305
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:45,013
Here.

306
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,545
Why do you stand like this?

307
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,607
If you want to drink tea,
you should bring a chair and sit on it!

308
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,862
Ah... okay!

309
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:05,027
What's your name?

310
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:07,628
My name is Roy.

311
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:09,769
Roy...

312
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:15,465
Hm! Your parents souldn't
give you that funny name.

313
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:19,293
Does this...

314
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:21,754
<i>Does this village produce coal?</i>

315
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:22,668
<i>Yes.</i>

316
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:26,551
My grandfather was a worker in the mine.

317
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:27,926
Oh...?

318
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,645
Is that right?

319
00:16:29,793 --> 00:16:31,605
My husband too.

320
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:34,043
He was working in that mine.

321
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:35,490
What a coincidence!

322
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:38,277
A man was proud of him.

323
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:39,559
And...

324
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:42,488
And... what happened?

325
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:43,184
Oh...

326
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,941
I also think that your father
is proud of your hard work

327
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:52,777
because he was a mine worker, right?

328
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,820
Yes.

329
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,470
Oh, I was wrong?

330
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,598
That's unfortunate!

331
00:17:03,238 --> 00:17:04,246
Sorry...

332
00:17:04,418 --> 00:17:05,145
Uh?

333
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,401
Before my birth my father became a sailor.

334
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:10,738
That's why he visited many countries.

335
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:13,980
He was always yearning
for such a life of freedom.

336
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,965
I am shocked by his situation.

337
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,731
Huh?

338
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:20,020
I don't want to hear from you.

339
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,207
She's not looking here, it's time!

340
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,098
I can't hear anything!

341
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,035
They don't seem to speak at all!

342
00:17:43,098 --> 00:17:43,817
Hm...

343
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,918
Listen, Colin...

344
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:48,285
Yes, I see!

345
00:17:49,613 --> 00:17:51,650
Now, isn't the time to go,

346
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,496
John's cousin?

347
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,340
Yes.

348
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,621
That's it, goodbye!

349
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,785
Yes.

350
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,488
Ah! Don't do such a thing!

351
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,941
Lassie, let him go!

352
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:14,200
Ah?

353
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,402
<i>T-t-this is...</i>

354
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:18,855
<i>Give it to me, Lassie!</i>

355
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,045
T-this is...

356
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:24,402
I got it from my father.

357
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,644
Really...

358
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:28,409
This golden piece dates back
to the fifteenth century!

359
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:30,332
Could this be...

360
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:36,377
This is the gold piece that George took!

361
00:18:36,402 --> 00:18:39,666
How could a child like you have it?

362
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:42,050
I didn't know anything about it!

363
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:45,566
This is because my father
didn't tell me any word!

364
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:48,722
However, regardless of the extent of poverty,

365
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:52,269
 it can't be replaced by money
because it was as precious as he said!

366
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:53,160
Eh!

367
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,104
Is that right?

368
00:18:55,253 --> 00:18:57,800
<i>When my father became a sailor,</i>

369
00:18:57,948 --> 00:19:02,433
<i>he was afflicted with serious illness and yet
he worked hard to earn money for us!</i>

370
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:03,401
...But

371
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:07,745
But he never thought
of replacing this gold with money,

372
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,198
but rather did his best!

373
00:19:10,308 --> 00:19:11,425
Is that right?

374
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,144
So he didn't sold it!

375
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,956
That is why he worked hard

376
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:23,464
not to forget those days!

377
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:24,604
Roy!

378
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:25,300
Huh?

379
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,550
Don't stay there and come here!

380
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,190
<i>Because of my age I can't hear you.</i>

381
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,410
<i>Come closer and talk to me!</i>

382
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:35,580
I...

383
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,784
I'm very happy because I came to this village!

384
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:42,020
My father didn't work in the mine,
and became a sailor,

385
00:19:42,136 --> 00:19:44,144
yet I am still proud of him!

386
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:47,963
The ship he was working in was operated by coal!

387
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,430
The furnace of the ship was reddening, and it
was the coal that led him to the seven seas!

388
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,158
Charcoal xxx my father!

389
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,570
I'm glad I came here!

390
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,945
And found my grandfather here...

391
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,114
Grandmother...

392
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,709
I know that!

393
00:20:08,803 --> 00:20:11,820
Roy, you are... my grandson...

394
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,967
Grandmother!

395
00:20:16,178 --> 00:20:18,410
<i>Are you here, John Carraclough?</i>

396
00:20:18,522 --> 00:20:20,039
<i>- Show yourself immediately!</i>
- Eh!

397
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,451
You knew that!

398
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,820
Continue from Albert!

399
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:27,418
But my father returned to the bus!

400
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:30,140
But he is still in Jones' shop!

401
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:33,490
He won't go today as long as he thinks about it!

402
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:38,090
He thinks about what he will do all day long.

403
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,379
<i>No, you're wrong!</i>

404
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,795
Grandmother, I hid him from you!

405
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:43,260
Mr. Albert is here!

406
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,534
He's been here a while
and he' s listening to you!

407
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,217
Ah!

408
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,279
Hm!

409
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,833
That's why you tried to dismiss
my theory, John Carraclough!

410
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:53,528
Mom!

411
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,000
I will live in this village and
I won't leave again!

412
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,934
So...

413
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,880
I won't go anywhere...

414
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:05,575
Welcome back, Albert!

415
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,036
Mom!

416
00:21:27,794 --> 00:21:28,786
Oh!

417
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,419
Yeah, Albert!

418
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,710
Well, I'll take the picture now!

419
00:22:01,802 --> 00:22:04,165
<i>Coal ran out of the mine suddenly!</i>

420
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:06,747
<i>The mine will be closed!</i>

421
00:22:06,864 --> 00:22:10,434
<b>This is what my father did without sleep!</b>

422
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,716
<i>I...</i>

423
