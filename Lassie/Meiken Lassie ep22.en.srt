1
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,560
JOHN'S DECISION! PROTECT THE MINE

2
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,497
Oh, Lassie, you look busy!

3
00:01:40,263 --> 00:01:41,760
Here it is, it has come!

4
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:43,396
Today it was exactly on time!

5
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,614
Lassie, it came, it came!

6
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:01,950
How can it know exactly when John come out?

7
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:12,950
What's up, Spinner?

8
00:02:13,357 --> 00:02:14,013
Uh!

9
00:02:14,356 --> 00:02:16,278
Everyone has already gone!

10
00:02:16,668 --> 00:02:18,488
What's wrong?

11
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:19,872
Uh...

12
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,231
I will leave this school soon...

13
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,890
Maybe we should part.

14
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:29,144
- Eh?
- Eh?

15
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:30,247
What is the matter?

16
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:35,704
Your father who worked in the mine
decided to resign?

17
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:36,552
Yes.

18
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,278
He'll stop working at the Wellington Coal Mine.

19
00:02:39,387 --> 00:02:41,466
He said he was looking for work elsewhere.

20
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:42,989
But why?

21
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:47,104
My father works harder in this business
than any other work

22
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:51,235
and this work is very good.

23
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:53,203
Hm... maybe that...

24
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,976
Lassie!

25
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:01,156
John is lucky!

26
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:04,663
Lassie goes with him wherever he goes!

27
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:16,937
<i>Dad, are you there?</i>

28
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,843
Where is it?

29
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:29,756
There must be another possibility!

30
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,671
Father!

31
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:33,715
Uh?

32
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,101
Ah, it's you John?

33
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:37,078
I'm is a bit busy today!

34
00:03:37,578 --> 00:03:41,148
You promised to go tomorrow
for fishing because it is vacation!

35
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,187
- Fishing?
- Yes!

36
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:47,296
Haven't you prepared the tools? Should I do it?

37
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:48,937
Huh! That's bad!

38
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:50,912
I promised you for tomorrow already!

39
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:52,295
Are you busy?

40
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,429
No, I just had this pile of books
so I decided to read them!

41
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,256
Ah, I'm sorry, John!

42
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:02,288
I forgot that!

43
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,656
It's okay, but...

44
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,240
I've heard that the Wellington Coal Mine
is in trouble, is that right?

45
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,375
Oh...

46
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,773
What are you saying, John?

47
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:13,304
It's nothing like that!

48
00:04:13,944 --> 00:04:14,663
Oh really?

49
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,233
Hm? Yes!

50
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,030
Where did you hear this talk?

51
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:22,724
From Spinner.

52
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,550
Spiner's father is looking for another job.

53
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:27,115
He will soon resign.

54
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,849
Is that right?

55
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:31,052
He is looking for another job...

56
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:32,833
Father!

57
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:34,201
Yes!

58
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:38,349
Coal output may have been
fewer recently but...

59
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:44,068
What is it? I'm sure that the next
outputs will be better!

60
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:45,318
Oh really?

61
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:47,653
- Certainly?
- Yes!

62
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,295
This is what the manager
and all the miners say!

63
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:53,200
We will succeed without a doubt!

64
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:56,388
I'm sure there's plenty of coal waiting for us!

65
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,330
I see!

66
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:01,224
That's why you read these books!

67
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,341
Do your best, Dad!

68
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,380
Yes!

69
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:08,614
We can go fishing when you
get out a lot of charcoal again!

70
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,295
Oh?

71
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,290
Yes!

72
00:05:11,415 --> 00:05:12,782
- Good night!
- Good night!

73
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,009
<i>Mom's in a night shift, let's go Lassie!</i>

74
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:29,259
Mr. Carraclough!

75
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:31,368
Please open the door!

76
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,462
I have something to tell you!

77
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:38,415
<i>We seem to be going to stop working next week.</i>

78
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:42,313
I wonder what will happen to us
when we resume work?

79
00:05:42,477 --> 00:05:44,509
Everyone is worried!

80
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,165
We must be patient.

81
00:05:46,282 --> 00:05:48,774
Can we get the salary?

82
00:05:48,964 --> 00:05:53,118
I'm doing everything I can,
so I'll talk to the president about it.

83
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,506
Will the coal... come out again?

84
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:58,360
Of course it will come out!

85
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:00,500
I'm sure about that!

86
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,500
Suppose it didn't come out?

87
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:03,992
Ah...

88
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:05,047
Let it be!

89
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:07,328
Mr. Carraclough told us it would come out!

90
00:06:07,687 --> 00:06:10,289
I trust what Mr. Carraclough says!

91
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,580
Probably...

92
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,461
<i>But my household savings are now over!</i>

93
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,258
Next week we will not be able to eat...

94
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,953
<i>We can believe in the work we do together!</i>

95
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,040
I also expected to be just soil!

96
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:37,735
Sir, what to do?

97
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:38,595
Hm?

98
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,844
Sir, what's your opinion?

99
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:55,770
Of course, I can't just judge this!

100
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,547
I can't, but...

101
00:06:57,735 --> 00:06:58,415
Huh?

102
00:06:58,696 --> 00:07:02,560
Coal didn't come out! And you can't!
What to do?

103
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,266
This analysis is not very accurate.

104
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,672
Do you ask me to give you urgent
results and perhaps make a mistake?

105
00:07:09,813 --> 00:07:10,961
Is that right?

106
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,344
So, isn't there some other way?

107
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,090
I can't say anything now!

108
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:17,035
I hope you dig for a longer time!

109
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:20,530
If we don't check the condition of the layer,
we will not come to a conclusion!

110
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:22,883
Thanks for your hard work!

111
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,108
Nothing!

112
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:31,944
<i>Yes...</i>

113
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:36,874
They must conclude quickly

114
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:38,400
so we won't do anything!

115
00:07:38,546 --> 00:07:39,187
Yes.

116
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,430
<i>Coal is supposed to exist...</i>

117
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,678
<i>This layer!</i>

118
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:48,335
This indicates that the range
is becoming relatively narrow.

119
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,497
My God! My God!

120
00:07:49,522 --> 00:07:55,000
But I think the coal layer is not over yet,
so we have to think of something else!

121
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:59,330
I worked in the coal mine for almost 40 years.

122
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:02,450
The results were very similar.

123
00:08:02,653 --> 00:08:07,248
But this time different, the coal
didn't come out suddenly!

124
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,490
It's a big problem!

125
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:12,397
However, each coal layer exits
the other coal 5 yards away.

126
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:16,287
I also have the same experience.

127
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:19,037
As old people say, it's very good!

128
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,077
Yes!

129
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,983
I want to be optimistic
but this is unfortunate.

130
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:29,959
Even if it is 5 yards away, but in fact the
distance has swelled to 20 yards, right?

131
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:33,040
I think previous experiences won't work here!

132
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,688
There is a possibility that coal will come out
when we dig larger than the usual layers.

133
00:08:37,713 --> 00:08:40,880
You, do you consider yourself a geologist?

134
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:43,508
Is it me or you?

135
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,516
No, I mean...

136
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:46,310
Bad! Bad! Bad!

137
00:08:46,755 --> 00:08:50,515
Look here, we can rely on Mr.

138
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:55,258
At least he should be able to come here,
even though he is a university lecturer.

139
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:56,383
Yes...

140
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:08,149
Hm?

141
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:14,618
Stop, stop here quickly!

142
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:15,509
Oh!

143
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:17,630
Wait Lassie! Hey!

144
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:20,579
Oh?

145
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:24,641
This car?

146
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,024
Lassie!

147
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:28,008
Hm? Is it your dog?

148
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:29,922
Eh? Yes!

149
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:31,821
What is your name?

150
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,047
John Carraclough!

151
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,605
So John...

152
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,485
The dog looks very good!

153
00:09:37,907 --> 00:09:38,603
Eh?

154
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,305
Thank you so much!

155
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:42,649
But... you really like it?

156
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:45,991
Ah! I like dogs very much!

157
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:48,912
Even his hair type is very good!

158
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:51,375
I brush it daily!

159
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:52,286
I see!

160
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:53,920
I apologize for interrupting you!

161
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:54,967
No problem!

162
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:57,583
I hope to see you next time!

163
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:58,250
Okay!

164
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:04,410
Actually, I like to praise you... Lassie.

165
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:08,400
I understand.

166
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:10,374
I knew what actually happened.

167
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,928
<i>Hello!</i>

168
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:14,428
Is Colin here?

169
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:15,739
He's on the second floor.

170
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,723
Thank you!

171
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:20,000
Although my house doesn't need
anything like that, though...

172
00:10:20,103 --> 00:10:23,236
What about coal? There's no way to get it out?

173
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,439
I don't know!

174
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:27,012
I don't really know that!

175
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,340
Sorry...

176
00:10:29,403 --> 00:10:31,833
Did I got any message?

177
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,403
No, not yet.

178
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:34,637
<i>I see.</i>

179
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,757
Have you found another job?

180
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:38,555
No.

181
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,187
I also expected no benefit.

182
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:42,185
<i>It's the third time.</i>

183
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,226
<i>Don't lose hope!</i>

184
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,820
I'm sure you will find
a good job in the future!

185
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:47,758
Yes...

186
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,468
Good morning!

187
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,311
What's up, everyone?

188
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:00,670
Spinner seems to have already moved!

189
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,434
Eh?

190
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:04,210
But he doesn't know yet when that will be!

191
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:07,770
He said that his father
suddenly found a new job.

192
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,991
I don't believe!

193
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:11,624
So I didn't say goodbye to him...

194
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,788
Everybody...

195
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:16,631
We couldn't say "farewell" to him...

196
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:18,811
John!

197
00:11:19,616 --> 00:11:20,921
John and Lassie!

198
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:24,709
You won't move to another place when
your father changes his work, does you?

199
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:26,544
Is not clear?

200
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,576
What strange words do you say, Colin?

201
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:31,358
I can't believe it...

202
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:43,499
Hm...

203
00:11:46,553 --> 00:11:47,499
- Hm?
- Hm?

204
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:50,381
<i>Close?</i>

205
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:53,150
Is this the result of the
realization of that world?

206
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:57,723
I told you that the owner is the one
who published this report.

207
00:11:57,748 --> 00:12:00,569
How can a report be published because
of such a simple investigation?

208
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,951
We could have reached another conclusion!

209
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:06,459
You understand what I really say?

210
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:08,748
I don't have the authority to do anything.

211
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:10,686
Please understand, Sam.

212
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,084
I can't understand anything!

213
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:16,175
Hey Sam! Where are you going?

214
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,550
To the owner!

215
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:21,240
It's bad!

216
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,834
<i>No way!</i>

217
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:28,610
This is unacceptable!

218
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,859
But Duke...

219
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,263
If you look at this article, you may find the
possibilities of returning a coal mine to Wellington!

220
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,476
Do you think the life is simple?

221
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:42,163
Do you believe the reports of the experts
or the words of the responsible director?

222
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:42,968
Uh...

223
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:44,133
Oh...

224
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:47,670
I apologize, but I'm very busy!

225
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:48,940
But...

226
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,705
Do you know the number of mine workers
who despaired of coal mining?

227
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,343
<i>Do you want to work quickly without interest?</i>

228
00:12:57,913 --> 00:13:01,491
They don't even know if they
can get the money or not.

229
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,190
Or you want to reduce the salaries of miners?

230
00:13:06,173 --> 00:13:09,751
What about that? Don't you think
that it's a good idea?

231
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,600
By the way, is not your son's name John?

232
00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:16,315
Yes...

233
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:20,220
Isn't your son's dog named Lassie?

234
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:21,031
Yes...

235
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:22,986
It's a very good dog!

236
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:23,830
Yes...

237
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,812
I also love dogs!

238
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:29,476
Many of my folks love kennel!

239
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,641
What do you think?

240
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,760
Of course when the mine closes you
will need money for your home.

241
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,111
Lassie...

242
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,134
Can't you give it to me?

243
00:13:40,056 --> 00:13:44,236
What do you think? Don't you want
to make a bargain with me?

244
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:47,189
I apologize for that, but I can't!

245
00:13:47,353 --> 00:13:48,300
Why?

246
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:50,330
Lassie is the friend of my son!

247
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:52,017
Excuse me!

248
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:55,690
That is strange!

249
00:13:55,822 --> 00:14:01,189
If he gave it to me, it would be
the best dog in this country!

250
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,095
<i>So, will you give up?</i>

251
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:06,314
I can't give up.

252
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:09,572
But the Duke also said in his place.

253
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:13,299
Dear, wouldn't you be able to extract coal

254
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:17,056
if you investigated more precisely?

255
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:17,744
Yes...

256
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:18,837
But...

257
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:23,775
When you came to this village you
worked at the Wellington Coal Mine

258
00:14:23,955 --> 00:14:27,191
for 15 years and faced many problems.

259
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:30,172
You did your best to solve such things!

260
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,102
You were always getting ready for things
like that, wasn't you, Sam Carraclough?

261
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,719
But everyone was doing their best!

262
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:37,805
For this you work harder!

263
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:42,179
You have to work hard with everyone to finish!

264
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:43,993
Yes!

265
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:45,110
This is true!

266
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,021
I will check the data again!

267
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:48,584
<i>Yes.</i>

268
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,639
This is what you want!

269
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:06,937
Ah, it's you John!

270
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:08,930
- It's my father's lunch!
- Okay!

271
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:11,867
Sam is in the mine now!

272
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:14,539
In the mine? My father?

273
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,115
Thank you. I will keep his food in his office!

274
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:19,726
Well, he is doing his best!

275
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:20,735
Yes!

276
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,226
My father works in the depths
of the earth to achieve his goal.

277
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:47,515
The size is 16 and 25 inches.

278
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:49,422
The number 17!

279
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,750
Between them one point?

280
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:54,553
<i>This is 8.5 inches!</i>

281
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:56,031
8.5 inches.

282
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:59,890
Sam, don't lose to those scientists!

283
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:05,108
As expected from the hard worker,
your influence will not affect you, right?

284
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,749
<i>John!</i>

285
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:17,749
He have finally slept!

286
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,828
Yes!

287
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,272
Ah, thank you, Lassie!

288
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,491
<i>How it was?</i>

289
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,616
As I expected, he can't trust my studies.

290
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,038
- Hm...
- Uh...

291
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,540
<i>Listen Lassie!</i>

292
00:16:56,663 --> 00:16:58,466
<i>When I see my father doing this,</i>

293
00:16:58,491 --> 00:17:02,132
I wonder what outcome
he has achieved in his work?

294
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:03,811
I'm sure...

295
00:17:04,094 --> 00:17:04,812
Oh?

296
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:08,639
I'm sorry!

297
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:10,920
I feel like I'm running away from you!

298
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:12,936
What are you talking about?

299
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,397
You have decided to make your family happy!

300
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:18,514
Take care of yourself! Okay?

301
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:22,380
Do your best, Hamilton, in your new city!

302
00:17:22,764 --> 00:17:24,190
<i>That's it, everyone!</i>

303
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,140
<i>Do your best!</i>

304
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,590
<i>Bye!</i>

305
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,944
- Take care of yourself!
- Live well!

306
00:17:28,077 --> 00:17:29,507
xxx

307
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,639
Lassie! Lassie!

308
00:17:40,522 --> 00:17:41,650
Father!

309
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:46,044
I wonder who will leave next time?

310
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,788
Although we worked for a long
time in the mine together!

311
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,999
He had to listen to Sam's words!

312
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,710
The Duke of Rudling is the grandfather of Priscilla

313
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,163
He is the man who praised you, remember him?

314
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,936
I'm sure he'll understand if he looks at you!

315
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,654
<i>I see!</i>

316
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:15,804
<i>You came to show me Lassie?</i>

317
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,538
Good! Good!

318
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,350
I hate how many times
I said it's still a good dog!

319
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,155
- That's wrong!
- Hm?

320
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,220
I understood, I knew you
would say something else.

321
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:35,233
Well...

322
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:39,608
Can you listen to my father again?

323
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:43,952
Did your father ask you to come today?

324
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:45,260
My father?

325
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:46,804
No, you're wrong!

326
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:48,694
My father didn't tell me that!

327
00:18:49,147 --> 00:18:53,060
When I look at my father,
I can't remain silent!

328
00:18:53,147 --> 00:18:54,145
So...

329
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,100
Please!

330
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:57,319
Listen to what my father has to say!

331
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,335
No!

332
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,507
Why?

333
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:01,350
Listen to me, John!

334
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,040
I don't want to get in too much trouble!

335
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:07,007
All I have to do is shut down the mine!

336
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:09,992
It is impossible to rely

337
00:19:10,077 --> 00:19:13,200
on the results of unreliable investigations!

338
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,760
This is how you handle things!

339
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,710
Do you have anything else?

340
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:19,468
Do you think I'm wrong?

341
00:19:20,397 --> 00:19:23,051
I'm glad you're a smart boy
who understands the situation!

342
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:26,483
But I still want you to reconsider that!

343
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:27,530
No!

344
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:28,531
Oh?

345
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,327
It's not possible!

346
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:32,781
But you will not know

347
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:36,705
that coal will come out or not
before you try again!

348
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:41,130
I don't have money to build
a big palace like you, Duke!

349
00:19:41,155 --> 00:19:43,512
I don't own a car!

350
00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:46,726
But even though all this is destined for me,

351
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:49,858
I will do anything to keep
the Wellington Coal Mine!

352
00:19:50,616 --> 00:19:54,380
You say you can take responsibility?

353
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:55,624
Eh?

354
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:57,272
Responsability?

355
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:03,492
Do you know that I'm talking about
a serious and important subject

356
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,819
that concerns the fate of many people?

357
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,811
I know perfectly well.

358
00:20:11,225 --> 00:20:14,632
That is why all your words

359
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:17,031
are met with responsibility!

360
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,271
This palace, the monastery,
all the buildings, companies

361
00:20:22,296 --> 00:20:24,984
and everyone are concerned
about this important talk!

362
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,904
I'm responsible for all this!

363
00:20:27,318 --> 00:20:30,146
But I don't know if coal will come out!

364
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:31,775
It's not like gambling or something like that!

365
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:35,162
It's not easy to deal
with such important things!

366
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:36,068
But...

367
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,935
But you have to try sometimes!

368
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:41,217
Oh?

369
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:45,724
So, what's your precious thing?

370
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:47,615
This...

371
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:52,872
For example the precious thing

372
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,066
you undoubtedly have is Lassie!

373
00:20:56,091 --> 00:21:00,607
<i>If you have to give it up, will you agree?</i>

374
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,005
Lassie...

375
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,934
<i>You can't, right?</i>

376
00:21:08,137 --> 00:21:09,637
That's it!

377
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:10,778
But...

378
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,350
Coal... as my father said...

379
00:21:13,434 --> 00:21:14,762
Coal...

380
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:16,044
Certainly...

381
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:17,551
Definitely will come out!

382
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:27,270
You must keep your word

383
00:21:27,864 --> 00:21:29,646
as you promised me!

384
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,685
Lassie, of course!

385
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:35,669
Until then...

386
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:39,106
Until then you will return to me!

387
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,739
I will be patient until the time comes!

388
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,140
<i>Dad, he'll definitely
get out the coal, won't he?</i>

389
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,720
<i>I must do anything!</i>

390
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,192
<i>I will help everyone with anything!</i>

391
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:07,401
<i>Otherwise...</i>

392
00:22:07,489 --> 00:22:10,091
<i>They will move Lassie to Scotland!</i>

393
00:22:10,618 --> 00:22:13,825
<i>Next episode:
DO YOUR BEST, JOHN, AND PROTECT LASSIE!</i>

394
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:15,190
<i>Be sure to watch!</i>
