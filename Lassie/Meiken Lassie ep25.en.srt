1
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,729
<i>Lassie!</i>

2
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,690
<i>Don't go this way!</i>

3
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,482
<i>Crossing such river is dangerous to you!</i>

4
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,208
<i>Lassie!</i>

5
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,450
<i>Lassie!</i>

6
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:13,553
Uh! Ah!

7
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,599
It's a dream!

8
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:19,740
Right.

9
00:02:19,865 --> 00:02:21,286
It's just a dream.

10
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,110
WELCOME BACK, LASSIE

11
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,247
<i>John,</i>

12
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:36,615
<i>There is no news of Lassie for today.</i>

13
00:02:37,177 --> 00:02:41,974
<i>Its last appearance was
three days ago of West Darlington.</i>

14
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:48,051
<i>But I'm sure Lasie has traveled safely and
it will arrive soon, that's what I think!</i>

15
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,747
Don't worry, Priscilla!

16
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:56,521
Lassie is in good health and is
on its way to... my house.

17
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,181
I thought of Lassie until the morning came...

18
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,750
It is the result of the geological survey.

19
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,660
If the result is zero,
I can't assume that!

20
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:39,431
Yes!

21
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:42,595
Let's do our best and find coal, Dad!

22
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:49,838
When I see these two working, I feel
that the coal will definitely come out!

23
00:03:50,252 --> 00:03:50,947
Yes!

24
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,210
Well, we too will not lose
to the current manager!

25
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:55,447
Yeah!

26
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:06,687
Ah Sandy!

27
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,408
How is your health?

28
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:10,182
Hm...

29
00:04:10,822 --> 00:04:13,175
There is no escape from that as you see...

30
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:15,041
What are you saying?

31
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,439
This is your gift!

32
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:17,299
Oh?

33
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,549
Thank you...

34
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,353
I... why I'm always so?

35
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,197
And to get sick at such an important time?

36
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,080
I feel embarrassed by myself.

37
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,416
I can't help John at all.

38
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:31,610
Maybe so!

39
00:04:31,713 --> 00:04:33,916
So the same with me!

40
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,752
All I can do is make tea at their own leisure!

41
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:40,791
Yes...

42
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,978
John is doing hard work like a man.

43
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:46,940
Ah...!

44
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:52,103
But when everyone treats the candy they offer
them will increase their strength as I think!

45
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,634
Thank you!

46
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:55,744
John...

47
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,368
Actually wants to find Lassie but he can't!

48
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:03,752
That's why he desperately tries
to find coal with others.

49
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,994
When Lassie returns,
they will always live together.

50
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:10,307
Hm...

51
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,877
I hope Lassie returns while he is in this area.

52
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,460
When I see it in good health,
I expect to stay next to it.

53
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:22,752
Hm...

54
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,541
I wish I could do even a little!

55
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:26,791
Ah...

56
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,236
You can't...

57
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,415
And now everyone!

58
00:05:35,549 --> 00:05:37,103
Time for tea!

59
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:39,479
Oh? What is our food today?

60
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,310
The meat pie is full of energy!

61
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:45,455
Every day I look forward to this moment!

62
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:46,869
Well, take a break!

63
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,775
What do you think?

64
00:05:59,387 --> 00:06:01,259
Yes! Thank you for the food!

65
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:06,654
W-what, did you eat already?

66
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:14,198
John!

67
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:15,222
Yes?

68
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,815
I don't help much!

69
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,425
Don't help too much?

70
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,784
You do everything you can!

71
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:24,370
Hm?

72
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:26,878
<i>What is that?</i>

73
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:29,284
Ah, one week only?

74
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,206
Yes.

75
00:06:30,587 --> 00:06:31,945
It is time to hold your breath!

76
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,448
Wellington Coal Mine has reached its limit.

77
00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:38,096
The bank is no longer able
to pay costs without interest!

78
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:41,210
Now we can't extract coal.

79
00:06:41,362 --> 00:06:42,900
Maybe we should give up.

80
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:45,000
But, just a week!

81
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:45,917
Sam...

82
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:49,963
I have to tell everyone the truth!

83
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:53,291
<i>We need to think about
the future of our new life!</i>

84
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,705
We should talk to John.

85
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:02,580
Do you have the power to tell him directly?

86
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:05,487
I'm not sure I can say it...

87
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,135
No, I'm going to do it.

88
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,674
I think you understand that too...

89
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:14,244
John has recently become more mature.

90
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,697
I wish that he was...

91
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,408
What is the matter with the manager?

92
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:26,424
He seems to be talking
about something different.

93
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,370
I hope to not say to stop it.

94
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,783
Hey he's coming!

95
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:33,870
Oh...

96
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,790
Listen everyone!

97
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:38,369
The manager has something to tell you!

98
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,270
You see?

99
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:56,346
Is it a unique stone?

100
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:58,393
I have extracted it from the wall!

101
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,666
Sandy!

102
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:01,791
This! Probably...

103
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,275
Just a moment, bring that book to me!

104
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,840
- The yellow one!
- Eh?

105
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:06,975
Oh...

106
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,768
Wait for me to sort them out first!

107
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:09,932
This one?

108
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,930
No... that one! The third one!

109
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,041
Right! That one!

110
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,190
Ah!

111
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:17,096
Hm...!

112
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:19,315
What is there?

113
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:21,657
There it is!

114
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:23,643
There it is! Ammonite!

115
00:08:23,823 --> 00:08:24,518
Eh?

116
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:25,635
Aah!

117
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,987
This is serious!

118
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,410
What is the matter?

119
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:30,010
That's serious, Sandy!

120
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:30,925
Hm...

121
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,658
<i>What is the matter?</i>

122
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:39,501
Manager, tell us quickly!

123
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:42,174
We are also about to lose our temper!

124
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:49,304
Manager, should I say that instead of you?

125
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,008
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:52,937
I can't say it!

127
00:08:58,211 --> 00:08:59,118
Everyone...

128
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:00,445
No...

129
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:01,617
I mean...

130
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:02,922
Somewhat...

131
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,719
No, I mean...

132
00:09:06,156 --> 00:09:08,340
<i>We have to let you all know...</i>

133
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,100
<i>Sir!</i>

134
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:13,062
Hey sir! It's serious!

135
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:14,359
Serious thing!

136
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:15,023
Hm?

137
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,281
What is the matter? Why you were running?

138
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,750
In fact...

139
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,836
What are you saying?

140
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,305
This...

141
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,125
Oh...!

142
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,883
There it is! It's a carbon
element of antiquity!

143
00:09:39,273 --> 00:09:40,547
It is an Ammonite...

144
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:42,367
This means...

145
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:44,039
What does it mean?

146
00:09:44,555 --> 00:09:48,648
Coal is a tree grown in the
earth since ancient times!

147
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:50,881
But this oyster...

148
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:51,914
This is not an object!

149
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:55,445
Ah... sir, it is a bit different...

150
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:56,586
Oh?

151
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,452
In any case, we have to determine

152
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:01,711
 the age of this object and it will
certainly determine the age of the tree

153
00:10:01,782 --> 00:10:03,515
 that has grown since ancient times
and is the main source of coal.

154
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,840
The object indicates
the presence of coal as well...!

155
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,793
Yeah, and charcoal too!

156
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,905
Well, we have to dig more!

157
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,157
We don't know what is coming
out to us, but let's dig, let's dig!

158
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:15,118
Yeah!

159
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,640
Ah, Colin!

160
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,340
Hey, John!

161
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,774
Thank you, Colin!

162
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,993
No way...

163
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:23,407
Sandy is the one who
picked it up from the mine.

164
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:25,883
I thought it was a plain stone.

165
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:27,704
Be proud of yourself!

166
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:40,211
<i>Hey! Something else appeared!</i>

167
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,375
Is it coal?

168
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,868
No, but it stirred up!

169
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:45,282
Traces, but...

170
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,891
What do you think?

171
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,649
It looks huge!

172
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,235
Professor, how was it?

173
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:58,536
It's good to find the entire body of Ariophus,

174
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:03,453
which is considered one of
the most important ancient relics!

175
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:06,951
I heard that the mine will close today!

176
00:11:06,976 --> 00:11:09,444
After that I can say that coal can go out

177
00:11:09,483 --> 00:11:12,120
according to previous geological studies,
but still little possibility.

178
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,934
And order to close the mine,
it's completely wrong.

179
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,413
So I have to tell the Duke
to abandon his decision.

180
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:23,207
That's all, sorry I'm going!

181
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,285
Thank you so much!

182
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:26,239
No.

183
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:29,199
You thank the children!

184
00:11:29,224 --> 00:11:29,950
Yes!

185
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,207
What? What about John?

186
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:35,207
He's in the place I found the oyster,
and digs with Mr. Pia and the others!

187
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:36,957
I'ts enough...

188
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,598
He wants to continue until the end!

189
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:46,051
<i>John!</i>

190
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:46,863
Hm?

191
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,988
You have to stop!

192
00:11:48,238 --> 00:11:49,820
Leave the rest to your father!

193
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:50,750
Yes, but...

194
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,528
<i>John, come here a little bit!</i>

195
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,543
What's up, Mr. Pia?

196
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,809
What happened?

197
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,371
We have finally done it, John!

198
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,960
<i>We did it!</i>

199
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,630
<i>We finally did it!</i>

200
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,676
<i>Coal has come out!</i>

201
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:28,309
Yeah!

202
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,540
Well done, John!

203
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:49,778
With this thing Lassie
can come back to me, right?

204
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:50,746
John...

205
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,699
After feeling comfortable I feel sleepy...

206
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:59,871
I'm glad I trusted you, Dad...

207
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,028
I... somehow...

208
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,442
Sleepy...

209
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,059
Lassie...

210
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:09,739
Oh!

211
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:11,778
John...

212
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,871
He felt relieved after he was nervous!

213
00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:28,067
So let him sleep.

214
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,879
What about Lassie?

215
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:35,380
I have received a message from
Priscilla but there is no news of it.

216
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:36,535
I see.

217
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,403
<i>Lassie...</i>

218
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,600
<i>Wait, Lassie!</i>

219
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,650
<i>Lassie...</i>

220
00:13:58,675 --> 00:14:00,840
<i>So we can always stay together!</i>

221
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,340
<i>Together...</i>

222
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:08,887
<i>Lassie is no longer on my side!</i>

223
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,610
<i>I wonder if it is still walking?</i>

224
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,582
<i>But, where does it walk in this world?</i>

225
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:21,335
<i>Lassie...!</i>

226
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,015
<i>Where did you go, Lassie?</i>

227
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,476
<i>Oh! Where are you now?</i>

228
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,265
<i>Where do you walk now?</i>

229
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,835
<i>Lassie!</i>

230
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,308
<i>Lassie!</i>

231
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,948
<i>Lassie... I'm sorry...</i>

232
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,003
<i>I've made you tire a lot!</i>

233
00:15:10,628 --> 00:15:11,487
<i>John?</i>

234
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:13,222
Oh?

235
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:17,893
Oh?

236
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,745
Priscilla?

237
00:15:23,651 --> 00:15:25,003
Did you sleep well?

238
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,200
They came from Scotland by plane.

239
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,526
By plane!

240
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,636
Did I sleep?

241
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:34,893
For two days!

242
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:35,996
Eh?

243
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,745
Have I really slept all this time?

244
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,308
<i>John!</i>

245
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,151
Congratulations!

246
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,542
Because of your faith,

247
00:15:44,706 --> 00:15:48,995
you brought the coal out again,

248
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:50,457
though I didn't believe it!

249
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,480
Yes...

250
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:53,346
<i>You've done a really good job!</i>

251
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:56,746
<i>Your heart has won over me!</i>

252
00:15:57,152 --> 00:15:58,105
However...

253
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,770
I apologise...

254
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:05,054
I promised you that I would give Lassie back.

255
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:07,418
But I couldn't keep it!

256
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,338
You are the only one who
can take care of Lassie!

257
00:16:10,363 --> 00:16:11,920
Right, Lassie!

258
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,900
I have to find Lassie!

259
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:18,121
Lassie is still walking towards our village!

260
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:18,864
Ah!

261
00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:21,335
Get out! My clothes!

262
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
- John!
- You'll change your clothes, John?

263
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,726
Listen, John

264
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:30,660
If Lassie returns,
it will be like a miracle!

265
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,715
Grandfather!

266
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,200
No!

267
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:35,101
<i>I apologize but I don't know what to say!</i>

268
00:16:35,343 --> 00:16:37,921
No, Lassie is still walking to here!

269
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:38,857
No...

270
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,100
I saw that!

271
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,286
That Lassie is coming here!

272
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,400
You have seen?

273
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,390
But, where are you going?

274
00:16:44,513 --> 00:16:45,535
Isn't it clear?

275
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,670
To the north side!

276
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:49,819
When Lassie left Scotland
it walked straight toward this village!

277
00:17:04,248 --> 00:17:05,498
Hey John!

278
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:06,790
Where are you going?

279
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,779
Lassie!

280
00:17:08,013 --> 00:17:08,865
Eh?

281
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,490
Lassie is on its way back here!

282
00:17:11,784 --> 00:17:13,574
It will arrive here soon!

283
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,303
Oh?

284
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,208
To north, to north!

285
00:17:23,654 --> 00:17:24,545
<i>To north!</i>

286
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,333
<i>This is the right direction!</i>

287
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:31,500
<i>If I turn here I will meet Lassie!</i>

288
00:18:07,272 --> 00:18:08,123
Huh!

289
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:11,120
Lassie!

290
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:25,343
Ah!

291
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:32,040
Lassie!

292
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,811
Lassie!

293
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,863
Lassie!

294
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,129
Lassie!

295
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,816
No way, Lassie!

296
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,816
Lassie!

297
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:22,293
Ah!

298
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:42,691
Lassie...

299
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,239
This way! John turned this way!

300
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,036
Ah!

301
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:11,396
Oh!

302
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:16,950
Are you okay, Lassie?

303
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,458
Can you walk to get home?

304
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:33,188
Hey!

305
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:34,400
John

306
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:35,641
Lassie!

307
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:36,665
Lassie!

308
00:20:38,782 --> 00:20:40,024
Lassie!

309
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:42,454
- Lassie...
- Welcome back, Lassie!

310
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,672
The Wellington Coal Mine is back in business!

311
00:21:17,697 --> 00:21:18,251
Yes!

312
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,195
Ah!

313
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,438
Look there!

314
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,593
John! Lassie!

315
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:29,680
Father! Mom!

316
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,188
Look, everyone came for you, Lassie!

317
00:21:40,493 --> 00:21:41,751
Hey!

318
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:42,876
Hey!

319
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:44,392
Hey!

320
00:21:59,493 --> 00:22:02,532
<i>After a long journey,
Lassie returned to our village!</i>

321
00:22:02,657 --> 00:22:06,267
<i>After that it became famous in the newspapers!</i>

322
00:22:06,634 --> 00:22:10,907
<i>That's why Duke Rudering decided
to organize a big party for it!</i>

323
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:14,571
<i>The last episode:
RUNNING TOWARDS THE DREAM</i>

324
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,118
<i>Be sure to watch!</i>
