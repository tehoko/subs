COLIN'S LOVE AND THE TREASURE

2
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:30,228
<i>I'm leaving!</i>

3
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:31,806
<i>Be careful!</i>

4
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:34,048
Lassie!

5
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:40,306
Thank you, Lassie!

6
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,579
You thought I forgot my bag and I was on
my way to school, so you brought it to me!

7
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,315
But I don't need a bag!

8
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:50,915
Today we will go for a stroll outside the city!

9
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,595
Look, this is for lunch!

10
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:58,120
So I don't want you to go to school today.

11
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,158
Do you want to go too?

12
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,185
Everyone is ready?

13
00:02:14,322 --> 00:02:15,783
Yes!

14
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,095
You understand, Lassie?

15
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:18,822
You have to wait until we move.

16
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,980
What will you do?

17
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,970
Hello John!

18
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:25,270
Will Lassie be released today?

19
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:26,900
Yes that's right!

20
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:29,533
Because they went to the cart regularly!

21
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:30,611
- Yes!
- Yes!

22
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,730
You seem to have difficulty in your youth.

23
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:37,370
The teacher ended up going in a school trip.

24
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,626
But I am very excited!

25
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:44,306
Everything is okay.

26
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:47,564
Hm?

27
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,892
Everyone, we will move now!

28
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:55,429
Take care not to fall from the cart!

29
00:02:55,454 --> 00:02:56,681
<i>- Yes!
- Yes!</i>

30
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,056
<i>- Now, please!
- Yes!</i>

31
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,564
Come on! Come! Come!

32
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,173
In here! In here!

33
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,353
What is it?

34
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,540
Nothing at all!

35
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,990
All of you, get off of the cart
and then board on the ship!

36
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:00,054
I go first to the reception!

37
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,765
We'll go get the tickets!

38
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:03,882
Okay!

39
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:05,480
Come on! Move! Move!

40
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:06,587
Y-yes!

41
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:11,701
Uncle, thank you!

42
00:04:11,726 --> 00:04:12,930
We depend on you to return!

43
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,812
Yes, be careful!

44
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,163
No, Lassie!

45
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:22,312
Eh?

46
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:23,328
- Oh!
- Oh!

47
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:25,023
- Uh!
- Uh!

48
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,100
We are on board now, but what next?

49
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:53,726
Where can I hide Lassie?

50
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,077
John, it's the teacher Curry!

51
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:56,921
Uh?

52
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,850
Colin, I rely on you to take care of Lassie!

53
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,179
Teacher!

54
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:04,562
What's the matter, John Carraclough?

55
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:06,577
Sorry, this...

56
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,140
<i>I have a question!</i>

57
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:09,890
<i>Uh?</i>

58
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,741
I must hide Lassie...

59
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:20,930
Oh?!

60
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,250
This is bad...

61
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:26,993
Uh!

62
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:29,938
Ah...!

63
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:33,165
Ah!

64
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,477
Lassie!

65
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,876
Thank you, dog!

66
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:42,524
That's great!

67
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,868
Hey!  You are...

68
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:44,869
Eh?

69
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,916
Ah!

70
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,938
My hat!

71
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,892
Damn, it was my hat that I loved!

72
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:55,509
Sorry...

73
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:01,266
We can't recover it anyway!

74
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:02,539
I will forgive you!

75
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,702
Right, I have to hide Lassie!

76
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:10,953
- Hide?
- Yes!

77
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,860
I know a good place!

78
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:14,454
Eh?

79
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,266
<i>I see!</i>

80
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:18,922
<i>I'm also going to the same place, Skull Island.</i>

81
00:06:19,203 --> 00:06:21,490
T-t-the same place?

82
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:27,492
But when we return I'll go to a different
ship, which is bound for Australia.

83
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,844
My father went before me
and now he is waiting for me.

84
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:32,571
You are a foreigner...

85
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,165
I wanted to see one of you already...

86
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,899
Tell me, what is the name?

87
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,093
It's Lassie.

88
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:45,102
Wrong, I mean your name!

89
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:45,704
Uh...

90
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:46,655
Uh... eh...

91
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:47,665
Co-Colin...

92
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,344
I'm Chris!

93
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:50,743
Nice to meet you, Colin!

94
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,711
Nice to meet you, Chris!

95
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:56,000
Nice to meet you, Lassie!

96
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:01,353
- Uh... uh...
- Hm?

97
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,461
A-a little while ago... What was that paper?

98
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,532
It seemed important.

99
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:07,785
That's it!

100
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:09,715
A treasure map!

101
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:11,137
A treasure map?

102
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:20,121
When I get to Skull Island
I'll look for a treasure!

103
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:22,570
C-can I help you?

104
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:25,629
Y-you can consider that instead
of the hat you lost!

105
00:07:26,285 --> 00:07:28,121
Lassie, do you want to go with us?

106
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,652
Colin Jones?

107
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:43,762
Does anyone know where Colin Jones is?

108
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,660
Maybe we should search the ship again!

109
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,255
It's bad!

110
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:49,707
He can't get out just like that!

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,918
This is because he's alone with with Lassie!

112
00:07:51,943 --> 00:07:52,559
Oh!

113
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,402
Could it have fallen into the sea?

114
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:56,215
Oh...!

115
00:07:57,325 --> 00:07:58,293
Oh...!

116
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:00,400
Colin! Las--

117
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,059
You brought Lassie with you?

118
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,902
No, I mean...

119
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,613
Teacher, I have a question!

120
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,035
I will answer later!

121
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,540
Teacher, I apologize for the delay!

122
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,946
<i>Colin, what about the dog?</i>

123
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,782
What do you want from Sebastian?

124
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,110
Sebastian?

125
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,039
Is this dog's name?

126
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:21,016
Yes!

127
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,532
Say "Hello", Sebastian!

128
00:08:24,657 --> 00:08:25,493
Hmm...

129
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,069
What about you?

130
00:08:27,094 --> 00:08:27,961
I'm Chris!

131
00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:30,102
We have become friends on the ship.

132
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:31,578
Well, okay.

133
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:36,010
Now get ready, we will eat
our lunch in the lighthouse!

134
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,602
<i>Now, let's move!</i>

135
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:39,039
<i>- Yes!
- Yes!</i>

136
00:08:40,774 --> 00:08:42,563
What does that mean, Colin?

137
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,883
Hello John! Sandy!

138
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:46,696
- Hm?
- Hm?

139
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,840
I'm Chris, nice to meet you!

140
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:50,977
Colin told me about you.

141
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:53,602
It was a good plan, right?

142
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:54,384
Ah...

143
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:56,046
Hello, Chris!

144
00:08:56,221 --> 00:09:00,483
When we have a vacuum, you need
to take care of the Lassie thing.

145
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,069
Yes!

146
00:09:01,094 --> 00:09:02,651
That would be a good idea!

147
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,057
I will wait for you in that place!

148
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:05,682
Yes!

149
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:07,299
I rely on you to take care of Lassie!

150
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:09,455
Let's go, Sebastian!

151
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,502
Ah, a moment!

152
00:09:12,205 --> 00:09:13,182
This...

153
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,377
It's Lassie's lunch.

154
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:17,085
I understand, see you!

155
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:19,038
We'll meet later!

156
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:21,700
- Farewell, Chris!
- No... But...

157
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:22,859
As I thougt!

158
00:09:22,884 --> 00:09:24,749
Hey Lassie!

159
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:25,515
- Oh!
- Oh!

160
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,720
When it heard its name it didn't turn back.

161
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,788
Maybe it's really another dog!

162
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:34,008
- Ah...
- Ah...

163
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,600
It's nice to listen to the sea, Robert!

164
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,888
I want to go too!

165
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:43,760
Me too!

166
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:46,390
Treasure hunt... This is very exciting!

167
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:48,820
Is it on that island?

168
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,350
It's an island but we can walk on it.

169
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:52,495
Okay!

170
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:54,824
In leisure time to look for treasure!

171
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:55,988
Hooray!

172
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:57,152
Hm?

173
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,238
Colin?

174
00:09:58,511 --> 00:09:59,628
Everyone!

175
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:03,441
You can go down to the white sandy beach
in the afternoon when it's warm!

176
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:05,540
Don't go far away!

177
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,995
Also don't go on that island!

178
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,049
<i>You understand?</i>

179
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:11,300
<i>- Yes!
- Yes!</i>

180
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:13,700
We can't go to the island...

181
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:14,932
I wonder why?

182
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,902
Hm...

183
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:24,142
Were you waiting?

184
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:24,964
Yes!

185
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:27,308
- And this will restore Lassie to you!
- Yes!

186
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:28,925
John!

187
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:31,948
I have to go with Chris.

188
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:32,472
Eh...

189
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,839
But the teacher said...

190
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:36,751
Colin, I don't want to force you.

191
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:38,040
I can go by myself!

192
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,284
No, it's okay!

193
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:41,675
I want to go...

194
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:43,613
A-ha!

195
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:45,425
Is that so, Colin?

196
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,915
I will go too!

197
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,917
You can't!

198
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,415
Ah, why?

199
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,740
It's okay!

200
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,901
Colin, you can go on your own!

201
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:53,938
E-eh...

202
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,127
Alone...

203
00:10:56,471 --> 00:11:00,346
Sorry, I wanted to take Lassie with us but...

204
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:02,361
It's okay!

205
00:11:02,424 --> 00:11:04,280
W-what is the matter?

206
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,370
Sorry, John.

207
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,549
Come on, Chris!

208
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,820
I'll borrow Lassie again.

209
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:10,603
<i>Lassie!</i>

210
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:18,940
Ah...

211
00:11:18,986 --> 00:11:21,431
Lassie follows them too...

212
00:11:21,657 --> 00:11:24,195
Listen, why can't I go?

213
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,868
John, it's too boring!

214
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:27,928
Boring?

215
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,241
I mean...

216
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:30,888
Eh...?

217
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:32,177
Love her?

218
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:33,342
What does Colin mean?

219
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,889
That's true!

220
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:36,351
Eh...?

221
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,322
<i>Listen, how does the treasure look?</i>

222
00:11:56,454 --> 00:12:00,133
Could you have seen two hackers before?

223
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:01,330
Wrong!

224
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,070
It's a little trifle!

225
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,525
In the eyes of people is worthless!

226
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,680
But for me it's my precious treasure!

227
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:10,544
Right...

228
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:13,740
It isn't a pirate treasure.

229
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:14,996
What do I have?

230
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:15,840
Oh!

231
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:20,279
Not so, but I knew nothing
about the treasure at all.

232
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:24,287
- Huh?
- Oh?

233
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,099
Let's go!

234
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,005
Wait! Chris!

235
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:36,566
I want to look for treasure...

236
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:37,865
But Colin...

237
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,530
Do you really love Chris?

238
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:42,260
I think he doesn't care about that.

239
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:43,315
Oh!

240
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,140
What are you doing?

241
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,810
I was just xxx!

242
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,088
John the insensitive!

243
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,210
What?

244
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,735
Do you know anything about the age of love?

245
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,010
Damn, I'm not insensitive...

246
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:54,916
- Oh!
- Ah!

247
00:12:54,986 --> 00:12:56,140
Just for you!

248
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,861
Boy!

249
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,661
<i>We have climbed a lot!</i>

250
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:08,832
Chris, is this really the way?

251
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:12,223
Yes, if we walk this way we will
reach the top of the island!

252
00:13:12,544 --> 00:13:13,169
Ah...

253
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,192
Up to the peak...

254
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:17,810
Ah...

255
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:20,390
Are you fine? You're tired?

256
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:22,106
I-I'm fine!

257
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,676
That's it...

258
00:13:24,018 --> 00:13:24,589
Oh?

259
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,896
<i>It's pushing hard...</i>

260
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:35,849
<i>John Carraclough!</i>

261
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,925
John Carraclough!

262
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,839
I have a question for you!

263
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,488
Y-yes...

264
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:45,941
- Uh...
- Uh...

265
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:51,680
This...?

266
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,422
It's a landslide...

267
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,039
I don't believe it!

268
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,773
Although we have had all
the trouble to get here...!

269
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:00,993
Oh!

270
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,102
Lassie does it perfectly!

271
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,375
Let's go through there!

272
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:12,742
Look, Lassie walks the natural way!

273
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:16,076
But we can't climb like Lassie!

274
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:17,539
Don't worry!

275
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,680
I'll make holes for climbing, with this.

276
00:14:19,915 --> 00:14:21,305
Ah? Yes!

277
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,613
I'll start digging!

278
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,746
So stay away and wait!

279
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:26,434
Yes!

280
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,601
Now climb up, Chris!

281
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:52,101
Yes!

282
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,952
Don't look down!

283
00:14:57,108 --> 00:14:59,500
Yes, you can fix your feet this way!

284
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:00,242
Come on!

285
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,070
We have already reached the peak!

286
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:08,765
Yes!

287
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,937
And now...

288
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,632
Listen, show me the map!

289
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:12,211
Yes!

290
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:13,148
Yes!

291
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,687
A compass!

292
00:15:15,851 --> 00:15:17,562
It looks like a real treasure!

293
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,983
But it doesn't help as long
as we don't have a map!

294
00:15:21,124 --> 00:15:22,380
Not like that!

295
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:24,854
Thay way is the lighthouse.

296
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:27,617
So I think the treasure is to the northwest.

297
00:15:28,073 --> 00:15:29,213
Eh...?

298
00:15:30,822 --> 00:15:32,072
What do you see to see there?

299
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:34,979
Ah...!

300
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,820
Just awesome!

301
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:44,518
What's up, Lassie?

302
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:46,237
- Hm?
- Hm?

303
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,487
- Ah...!
- Ah...!

304
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,088
<i>The road has disappeared!</i>

305
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,633
The sea was sunk by the tidal wave...

306
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,319
Hey...!

307
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:58,084
Someone help us!

308
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:00,344
The road has disappeared!

309
00:16:02,757 --> 00:16:04,569
They can't hear us!

310
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,210
This is not the time to search for treasure...

311
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,054
<i>We have to think about the way back.</i>

312
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,074
Colin, can you swim?

313
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,792
I can't swim...

314
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:19,310
Me neither...

315
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,902
In the meantime, John and
Sandy will notice that!

316
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:28,245
If they don't notice quickly, the ship
bound for Australia will be departed.

317
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,574
Me too, maybe I can't...

318
00:16:31,831 --> 00:16:33,805
Anyway, let's go!

319
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,917
<i>I don't mind not going to Australia...</i>

320
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,902
Chris...

321
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,980
The treasure was a memory of my mother.

322
00:16:45,331 --> 00:16:46,386
A memory?

323
00:16:46,824 --> 00:16:49,910
<i>My mother died last month.</i>

324
00:16:50,004 --> 00:16:50,629
Ah!

325
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,222
My father remembered when
they lived in the same house.

326
00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:59,722
He therefore decided to live
in a foreign country to build a new life.

327
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,441
I really want to live here!

328
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:06,027
But I can't say that to my father...

329
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,074
I see...

330
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,455
So before leaving England

331
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:13,974
I decided to look for my mother's memory.

332
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:20,575
<i>When I was small, my father, my mother
and me came here to play a treasure game.</i>

333
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,474
<i>It was fun...</i>

334
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,904
The map is from my mom
that's why I care about it a lot.

335
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:29,919
After all this...

336
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:32,631
I haven't found it...

337
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,630
Let's go and find it... Chris!

338
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:39,801
Eh?

339
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,650
You can't leave without your precious treasure!

340
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,510
But we have to think about the return!

341
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,204
I-I'll find a solution!

342
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:49,743
So let 's go, Chris!

343
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,189
Yes!

344
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,320
North West! North West!

345
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,140
Chris, is it that way?

346
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,126
Yeah, no mistake on that!

347
00:18:12,947 --> 00:18:13,666
Ah!

348
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,330
<i>It's there!</i>

349
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,267
<i>It was buried under that tree!</i>

350
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,035
You're not wrong?

351
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:20,970
When I was little I was here!

352
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:22,884
- We've found it!
- Yes!

353
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:25,010
Ah!

354
00:18:25,064 --> 00:18:28,298
My mother planted the seed,
it has already grown!

355
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:29,642
And now let's dig!

356
00:18:29,814 --> 00:18:30,361
Yes!

357
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:40,463
- Ah...!
- Ah...!

358
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,673
<i>Ah! Beautiful!</i>

359
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:49,542
My mother wanted to see
him with someone else.

360
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,957
It seems to have something written!

361
00:18:52,403 --> 00:18:53,567
Oh really!

362
00:18:54,653 --> 00:18:56,215
<i>Dear Chris,</i>

363
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,465
<i>When you read this you should
be grown up and be a good girl.</i>

364
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:09,746
Mom!

365
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,190
I have to go to Australia!

366
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:20,317
If my father doesn't see me,
I'll be in trouble!

367
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:24,169
Yes...

368
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,129
Let's go back...

369
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,264
Even if it slips from me, I won't sink.

370
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:36,936
I will swim and call for help.

371
00:19:37,061 --> 00:19:38,796
At this time, just wait.

372
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,030
I'll go with you!

373
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:43,584
It's not good to go both of us!

374
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:45,725
So we won't be able to help each other.

375
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,498
But...

376
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,990
I'll be fine, leave the rest to me!

377
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,584
Colin...!

378
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,467
Do your best, Colin!

379
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,209
Faster! Faster!

380
00:19:57,904 --> 00:19:58,615
Lassie!

381
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,568
If delayed, the ship bound
for Australia will be departed!

382
00:20:03,014 --> 00:20:04,240
Lassie!

383
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:07,260
Stop it, Colin Jones!

384
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,900
Go back to the ground quickly!

385
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,951
Turn! Turn around!

386
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,180
We will help you now!

387
00:20:12,405 --> 00:20:12,955
Ah...

388
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,295
We survived...

389
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,100
xxx

390
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,750
The ship bound for Australia
will leave immediately!

391
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,270
Don't be late!

392
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:24,303
Yes!

393
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:26,959
She seems to have no time.

394
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,560
You have to say farewell now.

395
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,730
Yes...

396
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,225
Chris, I'm sorry.

397
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,662
Are you okay?

398
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:36,443
You go to Australia...

399
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,139
Thanks to you, Colin, I found
the most precious thing!

400
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:42,389
Thank you, Colin!

401
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,344
Ah!

402
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:45,687
- Ah...!
- Ah...!

403
00:20:47,835 --> 00:20:49,187
Thank you, Lassie!

404
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,226
Goodbye, John! Sandy!

405
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,546
Goodbye, Chris!

406
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:56,937
Goodbye!

407
00:20:58,294 --> 00:21:00,239
Goodbye... Colin!

408
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,253
Chris! Chris!

409
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:09,805
Colin, I'll never forget
what happened this day!

410
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,328
Me too! Me too!
I'll never forget!

411
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:14,876
Goodbye! Goodbye, Chris!

412
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:17,775
Goodbye... Chris...

413
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,680
Chris has already left.

414
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:24,262
Listen, did you find the treasure?
What was it?

415
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:25,861
I'm sorry, John...

416
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,721
<i>It's a secret!</i>

417
00:21:28,564 --> 00:21:30,353
<i>It's only for two people!</i>

418
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,971
Colin...

419
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:35,830
Isn't it, Lassie?

420
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,275
And now everyone, get ready to go!

421
00:21:38,502 --> 00:21:40,197
Woe to you!

422
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:45,180
<i>We have to go back because
it's waiting for us now!</i>

423
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,084
<i>Has the influenza epidemic
spread in the village?</i>

424
00:22:02,216 --> 00:22:04,295
<i>Even my father got sick and stayed at home!</i>

425
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,850
<i>And daily visit,</i>

426
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:08,230
<i>are very tiring for my mother!</i>

427
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,705
<i>Is she okay?</i>

428
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,693
<i>Next episode:
IT IS SERIOUS! MY MOTHER FELL</i>

429
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:15,224
<i>Be sure to watch!</i>
