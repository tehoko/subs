1
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:25,523
<i>Ah, that's great!</i>

2
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,280
IT IS SERIOUS! MY MOTHER FELL

3
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:27,910
<i>It's just fever!</i>

4
00:01:28,014 --> 00:01:30,280
<i>So I can go to work!</i>

5
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,889
<i>No! No!</i>

6
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:35,635
<i>But I'm worried about the workflow.</i>

7
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:37,550
No! No!

8
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,830
It's very important to relax
until you get better from fever.

9
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:41,877
Yes...

10
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:46,030
You can miss another day, right?

11
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:47,870
I see.

12
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:50,439
If it's only for today...

13
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,275
Lassie!

14
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:55,009
Watch Sam well and don't let him get up!

15
00:01:57,188 --> 00:01:59,665
Yes, yes, I understood, Lassie!

16
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:18,450
Ah, I'm fine, Lassie...

17
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,747
Just feel a little bit dizzy.

18
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:22,817
What's up, Mom?

19
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:25,960
Ah, nothing, nothing!

20
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,490
Mom, you look tired!

21
00:02:29,614 --> 00:02:31,060
You also came back late last night.

22
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:31,685
Hm?

23
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,534
All these days...

24
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:35,645
Thank you!

25
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,184
I'm just a bit tired!

26
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,770
But, I'm fine!

27
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,690
I have lots of patients!

28
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:42,981
I need strength!

29
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:47,685
I'm really fine, don't worry!

30
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,684
Please take care of your father!

31
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:51,286
Be careful!

32
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:52,021
<i>Yes!</i>

33
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,527
Melissa?

34
00:02:55,012 --> 00:02:58,988
I apologize but can you come later
to check on my family?

35
00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:00,980
Hasn't his temperature dropped yet?

36
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:01,700
<i>No!</i>

37
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:03,035
Ah, I see!

38
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:05,612
Oh, good morning!

39
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,730
How is your wife?

40
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,301
Thank you for your concern!

41
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,151
Ah, are you still going to work?

42
00:03:14,176 --> 00:03:15,180
I'm fine.

43
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:16,496
Be careful!

44
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,847
My God, my God, it's rare
to be treated so harshly!

45
00:03:24,223 --> 00:03:24,795
Oh!

46
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,930
Did you finish eating?

47
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,355
Thank you for the food!

48
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:31,793
Many people have had cough...

49
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,746
John... listen to me.

50
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:34,489
Eh?

51
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,644
<i>Your mother is busy these days, right?</i>

52
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,650
Yes...

53
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,885
She's works too much...

54
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:45,589
At these times you will be busy eating lunch.

55
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,049
<i>Yes, fever is rampant anyway...</i>

56
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:51,379
<i>But it's bad for her not to eat lunch.</i>

57
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:52,557
Yes...

58
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:53,480
I know!

59
00:03:53,597 --> 00:03:56,449
I'll bring the lunch to my mother!

60
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:59,746
Ah, I feel fine now!

61
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,558
Well, if that's it...

62
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,652
Let's go, Lassie!

63
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,041
I'm fine, Lassie!

64
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:07,652
I will rest in peace!

65
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,293
And now go!

66
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:19,175
Yes, this time I can help my mom!

67
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,120
<i>Hello!</i>

68
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,410
Mom?

69
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:25,551
Eh?

70
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:27,715
It's strange...

71
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,570
It was very busy, but the place is empty.

72
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,777
Where are you?

73
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,957
List of patients!

74
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,168
I see!

75
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:41,238
No more patient visits yet!

76
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:48,409
Hello!

77
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:49,104
Sorry!

78
00:04:50,316 --> 00:04:51,721
- Oh!
- Mom!

79
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:54,400
Mother, we...

80
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,777
I count on you to bring it
to the last floor!

81
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:11,430
And now won't hurt...

82
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,920
I'm not a child!

83
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,519
But you should be cured of fever immediately!

84
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,252
I'm sorry!

85
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,254
Still, I want you to visit us again!

86
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:21,222
It's okay.

87
00:05:21,308 --> 00:05:23,004
- You'll get better quickly!
- Yes!

88
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,121
Now, let's get to the next house!

89
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,143
Busy! Busy!

90
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:35,073
The pulse...

91
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,527
Well, that way the heat will be gone!

92
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,160
Don't worry, rest only!

93
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:41,864
Yes...

94
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:43,441
- Here!
- Thank you!

95
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:47,363
No, that's at least I can do!

96
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,918
But... my mom and the doctor...

97
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,495
<i>Mom!</i>

98
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:57,728
What is it?

99
00:05:57,784 --> 00:06:00,531
You forgot to take your lunch with you!

100
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:01,969
Oh!

101
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,560
Well, we'll be back here at five o'clock!

102
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,906
I must prepare medicines to
send them to patients in need!

103
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,390
This is tiring!

104
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,599
<i>All the people of this house are sick!</i>

105
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,732
<i>Sorry, how is it?</i>

106
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,974
Ah!

107
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:26,669
Yeah, it's a little high.

108
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:28,357
What about Jake?

109
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,154
The father who was in this
house treated him first!

110
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:36,591
So you'll get better quickly!

111
00:06:36,748 --> 00:06:37,543
Yes...

112
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:42,160
But we don't have enough fever medicines.

113
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:43,216
Yesterday...

114
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:46,818
Yesterday I ordered other medicines.

115
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:48,693
Maybe it won't arrive quickly.

116
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:52,591
As recently as his students didn't get up!

117
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:55,591
Maybe it will arrive tomorrow afternoon.

118
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:57,356
From here...

119
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,865
I will go and bring it back...

120
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,075
Oh!

121
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,083
Mrs. Carraclough!

122
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:04,810
Hey, she fell!

123
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:06,247
<i>Mom!</i>

124
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:08,435
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

125
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:16,075
<i>Mom!</i>

126
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:21,614
John...

127
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:24,364
Doctor!

128
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,880
I'm sorry!

129
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:27,880
No, I'm the one who should apologize!

130
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,091
I made you work so hard that it happened.

131
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,010
No, I will wake up immediately!

132
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,208
Mom!

133
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:36,841
I'm fine, John!

134
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:38,989
I'm just a little tired.

135
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,240
Patients are waiting for me now.

136
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,530
Mom, your temperature is too high!

137
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:44,992
<i>That's right!</i>

138
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,591
This is a medicine for fever!

139
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,520
Doctor!

140
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,935
This medicine is...

141
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:53,442
What are you saying?

142
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,720
It's normal for patients with fever
to receive injection!

143
00:07:56,817 --> 00:08:00,067
But the drugs will be delayed
until tomorrow afternoon.

144
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,918
Not until after the dawn of tomorrow!

145
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,720
Mr. Rice went to pick it up by truck.

146
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:08,110
You can inject this medicine
after the medication arrives.

147
00:08:08,246 --> 00:08:09,365
Mom!

148
00:08:09,465 --> 00:08:12,379
In any case, I never want to!

149
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,035
The other patients need me!

150
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,559
Mrs. Carraclough!

151
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:19,910
Your stubbornness won't be
as effective today as yesterday.

152
00:08:20,004 --> 00:08:21,510
But...

153
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:22,770
Oh?

154
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:24,028
<i>Hey!</i>

155
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:26,479
Sam, are you here?

156
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:28,190
- Go to the front!
- Yes!

157
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:40,420
We've heard that Mrs. Melissa
has fallen unconscious.

158
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,713
Oh... Ah...

159
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:42,854
Please enter!

160
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:59,470
I made soup for you,
so eat it and get better quick!

161
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:03,011
Melissa, everyone knows
you're concerned about them.

162
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:06,284
So everyone in the village appreciates it!

163
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,433
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

164
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:10,323
Excuse me!

165
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:14,100
Melissa!

166
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:16,115
Y--yes?

167
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,444
Everyone is in trouble now!

168
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:25,522
In the village there is one nurse,
she worked hard until she fell!

169
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,489
Grandma, don't say that,
you better appreciate her feelings!

170
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:32,467
Mrs. Carraclough!

171
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:35,536
Aren't the words of Grandma Forrest true?

172
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:39,272
It's better for you to get an injection to get
better, it's the desire of the people as well!

173
00:09:39,357 --> 00:09:40,760
- Doctor!
- That's right!

174
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:45,142
While you are at home, Mom,
I will help Dr. Hooper!

175
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:45,881
Oh!

176
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:47,014
John...

177
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,857
Lassie too...

178
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,756
I don't know what the syringe is,
but you have to get better soon,

179
00:09:54,788 --> 00:09:57,521
there's no one in your place!

180
00:09:57,546 --> 00:09:58,444
Mhm!

181
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,467
I understand...

182
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,281
My mother worked hard for everyone...

183
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:15,281
Yes! That's right, John!

184
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:16,249
<i>Well...</i>

185
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,555
I'll leave your wife to you, Sam!

186
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:20,937
<i>Y-yes!</i>

187
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:26,000
Doctor Hooper!

188
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:26,745
Hm?

189
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:29,848
Doctor, I mentioned earlier!

190
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:30,505
Hm?

191
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,970
I want to help you!

192
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,697
Help me?

193
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:36,610
It's hard for you, doctor,
to work alone, right?

194
00:10:36,682 --> 00:10:41,018
I'm not as good as my mother,
but can't I help you with a little?

195
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:43,331
Look, even Lassie!

196
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:44,565
Hm...

197
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:46,250
Even if you say so...

198
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:49,145
My mother was taking care of the patients too.

199
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:50,331
And I...

200
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,362
Okay!

201
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,670
I count on you, John! Lassie!

202
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:56,674
Yes!

203
00:11:04,114 --> 00:11:06,643
Well, the lungs are okay!

204
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,350
<i>John, the tongue inhibitor!</i>

205
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,250
Tongue inhibitor... yes!

206
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:10,881
Hm!

207
00:11:11,225 --> 00:11:12,537
Say "a"!

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,460
<i>- Laryngoscopy!</i>
- Yes!

209
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:18,879
Yes, is that the binoculars?

210
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:19,686
<i>Hm!</i>

211
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,990
<i>Okay!</i>

212
00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:22,590
Yes! This is...

213
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:24,952
You've got the tool names, haven't you?

214
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:25,842
Who is next?

215
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:28,224
No 21, Mrs. Harrison!

216
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,920
Okay!

217
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:33,887
Thank you!

218
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:34,740
Yeah!

219
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:36,060
Please get better quickly!

220
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,310
We still have a lot!

221
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:42,380
<i>Oh my God, my God!</i>

222
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,200
<i>The number of medicines is many
and can't be counted!</i>

223
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:47,270
Now I will deliver the next medicine!

224
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,325
Yes, I count on you!

225
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:51,990
I will check the inventory now.

226
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:52,795
<i>Okay!</i>

227
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:57,084
Even if his temperature is low, he is
still a person to be warned.

228
00:11:57,224 --> 00:12:00,974
The man with fever never changes!

229
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:04,912
Rice went to get the medicines,
I hope he will return quickly!

230
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,355
Damn!

231
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,920
I have to go back to the village quickly!

232
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,800
That way I will never move!

233
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,940
That's why I hate the city!

234
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,330
It's Dr. Hooper's medicine!

235
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:26,014
Ah...!

236
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,480
Good, there's only one house left!

237
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:31,404
Mr. Gabel!

238
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,030
Mr. Gabel?

239
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,527
<i>Shut up!</i>

240
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:40,023
<i>Open the door and come in!</i>

241
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:42,296
I can't let you in!

242
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,110
Sorry...

243
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,929
I brought your medicine!

244
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,428
A child? What happened to Melissa?

245
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,990
My mother is very sick,
that's why I came instead.

246
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:56,101
<i>I'm here!</i>

247
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,865
It's different from the usual
rheumatoid medication.

248
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,080
It's a fever medicine!

249
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,960
Please eat your full food!

250
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:04,508
Hm!

251
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,013
Well, I'm leaving now!

252
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:06,960
<i>Wait!</i>

253
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:08,812
What is it?

254
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,030
Even food can't be eaten, as you see.

255
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,257
I can't move from bed.

256
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:16,257
Then...

257
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:19,460
You ask me to make food for you?

258
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:20,398
That's true!

259
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:22,694
I can't take this medicine.

260
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,492
Oh...

261
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,234
Whoa!

262
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:26,958
It's not possible!

263
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:28,577
I have to start by washing dishes!

264
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,470
I don't have any pot to use!

265
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:32,010
Do you have any complaint?

266
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,415
Melissa always does that!

267
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,533
Mom?

268
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:37,166
Okay!

269
00:13:38,682 --> 00:13:41,412
Mom, do this too...

270
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,830
I have finished!

271
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,141
Well, I'm going now!

272
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,158
<i>Wait!</i>

273
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:52,626
So?

274
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,228
I hope you always come.

275
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:58,924
<i>You do this well.</i>

276
00:13:59,041 --> 00:13:59,845
Is that right?

277
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:03,252
I will ask you to do so from now on.

278
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:07,459
Uh!

279
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:10,481
Dr. Hooper!

280
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,896
He's walking fast!

281
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,513
What? What is the matter?

282
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,334
Mr. Gabel, I have to go now!

283
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,927
I think Dr. Hooper has many patients!

284
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,646
Wait a moment!

285
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,475
I'm sorry, but I really have to go!

286
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,769
xxx!

287
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,693
If you open the cabinet
you will find a bottle shelf.

288
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,610
<i>It's the special strawberry drink.</i>

289
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:33,380
<i>It have been very helpful to me.</i>

290
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:35,903
<i>That's why I should give Melissa this drink.</i>

291
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,833
<i>Melissa always looked after me
without grumbling.</i>

292
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:43,661
Thank you, Mr. Gabel!

293
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:45,966
I... I will come again!

294
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,434
Doctor Hooper!

295
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,800
Oh, John!

296
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:55,410
Jake's temperature has risen.

297
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,833
Ah, this boy?

298
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,780
It was worse because we weren't careful.

299
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:06,348
Aunt...

300
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:09,942
Is Jake okay?

301
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,340
What? He don't have pneumonia.

302
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,442
If it doesn't get to the point he will be fine.

303
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,880
Well... I will take care of him now!

304
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,950
Aunt, you have to rest!

305
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:22,981
But...

306
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,870
I will take care of Jake.

307
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:28,419
Aunt, you have to recover your health quickly!

308
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,070
But this...

309
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,715
When you get well, Auntie,
you can take care of Jake!

310
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,247
Isn't it, Doctor?

311
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,450
<i>Right!</i>

312
00:15:37,044 --> 00:15:39,208
Now go back to your bed.

313
00:15:39,426 --> 00:15:42,281
Tomorrow morning when you recover

314
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:44,953
you can hug Jake as much as you want.

315
00:15:45,063 --> 00:15:45,742
Yes...

316
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:54,757
How is it?

317
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,700
How is his temperature?

318
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:57,547
Hm...

319
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,750
The temperature is high.

320
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,760
Still high?

321
00:16:02,852 --> 00:16:03,435
Yes.

322
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:07,250
Well, it's just a fever,
so there's no need to worry.

323
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,510
His temperature can decrease
if we observe it well.

324
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:13,273
We must wait for Rice to return.

325
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,701
<i>Damn!</i>

326
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:22,062
It broke at such a time...

327
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,703
I have a lot of work!

328
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,678
The medicine hasn't arrived yet.

329
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:28,945
<i>Doctor Hooper!</i>

330
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,547
Hm?

331
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,562
I went to the clinic and found the paper
where you wrote that you are here!

332
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:33,570
What is the matter?

333
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,836
My mother's fever has increased again!

334
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,742
Please take a look at her!

335
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,040
That's all. I have to go to Olsen's house.

336
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:45,450
I apologize but please take good care of Jake.

337
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,730
If his temperature suddenly rises,
tell me immediately!

338
00:16:49,984 --> 00:16:50,734
Yes!

339
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:54,272
Ah, also don't forget to dry the towel again!

340
00:16:54,468 --> 00:16:56,420
- Yes, Doctor!
- Bye!

341
00:16:58,857 --> 00:17:00,062
Good...

342
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,843
Let's do our best... Lassie!

343
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:14,640
I am thirsty...

344
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,992
Do you feel thirsty?

345
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:18,086
Do you want water?

346
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:18,797
Yes.

347
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,914
Wait!

348
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:27,500
Oh!

349
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,330
Well, sleep now.

350
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:40,720
I will turn off the light now
so don't be surprised!

351
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:50,659
<i>Yes.</i>

352
00:17:50,739 --> 00:17:52,259
<i>He sleeps deeply.</i>

353
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,323
Ah...!

354
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,502
Even if I kept changing, it was still hot!

355
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:19,628
Ah...

356
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,166
<i>It's time to measure his temperature!</i>

357
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:25,229
Thank you, Lassie, for waking me up...

358
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:46,026
Has time passed already?

359
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:01,221
I can't...

360
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,252
It has grown again...

361
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:11,530
It's bad! Jake!

362
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:14,411
What to do? His temperature has risen!

363
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:16,270
What? What's with this blanket?

364
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:19,077
What? Did you wake up, John?

365
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,512
Mom, is that okay?

366
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:23,204
Thank you for your hard work!

367
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,590
By the way, Jake...

368
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,660
Oh, that's right!

369
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,180
<i>Calm down, John!</i>

370
00:19:27,262 --> 00:19:28,543
He needs cooling!

371
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,481
I wish we had snow.

372
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:31,052
Eh?

373
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:31,942
Snow?

374
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,778
Would you be okay with the snow?

375
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,390
Lassie, we must find snow quickly!

376
00:19:37,512 --> 00:19:39,425
But where do we get it from?

377
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:44,887
Excuse me, Mr. Nelson!

378
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:48,466
W-what do you want at a time like this?

379
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,825
If there is snow in your refrigerator,
give it to me please!

380
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,900
In the Parkinson house, it's Jake!

381
00:19:53,043 --> 00:19:54,651
<i>Jake has a high temperature!</i>

382
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:56,114
What? This is a big problem!

383
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,362
That's enough, John.

384
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:13,879
Now he calmed down.

385
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:23,910
If I sleep a little...

386
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,778
After an hour we'll exchange places.

387
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,746
So Mr. Rice is back.

388
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:32,566
It will be a problem if the fever returns.

389
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:33,605
Okay! Okay!

390
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:38,387
Hm?

391
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,191
What's up, Lassie?

392
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,886
Lassie?

393
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:52,357
Lassie!

394
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:55,647
Oh?

395
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:57,185
What is wrong with you?

396
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,053
<i>What? Do you want me to follow you?</i>

397
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,220
Lassie?

398
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,006
Sorry sorry, I'm late!

399
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:06,998
Doctor Hooper!

400
00:21:08,022 --> 00:21:08,874
Ah...!

401
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,350
Hey Doctor!

402
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,820
Why are you here?

403
00:21:12,928 --> 00:21:14,678
I brought medicines!

404
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,845
Lassie is the one who brought Mr. Rice here!

405
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:21,100
Mom! The medicine! The medicine arrived!

406
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,053
Thanks for your hard work!

407
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:32,692
That's great, Jake, you've already recovered!

408
00:21:32,717 --> 00:21:34,764
So, even you, Mom, I'm happy!

409
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,732
<i>You worked hard, John!</i>

410
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,365
No, but you, Mom, you always
work hard and always...

411
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:45,889
Always do your best!

412
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,670
I am proud because you are my mother!

413
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:04,655
<i>Grandmother Forrest's son returned
to the village 20 years later.</i>

414
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,474
<i>But the grandmother didn't reply
and didn't received her son.</i>

415
00:22:08,724 --> 00:22:12,224
<i>At that time, her grandson also appeared.</i>

416
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,900
<i>Next episode:
I WANT TO SEE MY GRANDMOTHER</i>

417
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,233
