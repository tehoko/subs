1
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,860
You don't want to close the Wellington
Coal Mine and stop the work!

2
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:27,905
Yes!

3
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,389
In this way I have to pay the mine workers

4
00:01:32,921 --> 00:01:35,897
the usual salaries!

5
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:39,733
Of course you have to take responsibility!

6
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,882
You have to give me your most precious thing!

7
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:48,430
You have to give me Lassie for that!

8
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:50,180
As I said exactly.

9
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:53,672
And when the coal comes out,
I will give you Lassie back!

10
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:55,353
But, if not...

11
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:57,705
<i>Lassie will be mine!</i>

12
00:01:58,971 --> 00:01:59,830
Yes!

13
00:02:00,182 --> 00:02:04,590
Do you trust your father so much?

14
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:05,635
Yes!

15
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:07,486
But...

16
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,270
I'm sure the coal will come out!

17
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,345
Then I will regain Lassie!

18
00:02:12,518 --> 00:02:13,096
Ah!

19
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:16,932
Lassie!

20
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,830
DO YOUR BEST, JOHN, AND PROTECT LASSIE!

21
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:36,580
Good morning, Mom...

22
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:39,601
Ah, good morning John! I already ate!

23
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,400
Father haven't returned since yesterday?

24
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:44,564
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:47,569
I've returned after you fall asleep last night!

26
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:50,677
But John grew up a lot!

27
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,217
You still have Lassie!

28
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:53,717
Always...!

29
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:55,225
Mom!

30
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:57,387
I have to go to work now!

31
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,848
I'll leave the rest to you!

32
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,262
Lassie...

33
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:05,348
I can't do anything.

34
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:08,157
But I...

35
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,016
I can't stay alone anymore!

36
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:12,520
I know!

37
00:03:12,602 --> 00:03:16,001
After school I'll go to the mine, won't I?

38
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:23,727
Who were you talking to exactly?

39
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,470
I'll do anything!

40
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:43,312
It's bad!

41
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:45,149
<i>As I expected here!</i>

42
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:48,285
Oh? Bad, how long is it now?

43
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,095
It's the tenth!

44
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:53,325
As long as the tenth indicates
that I have grown a lot.

45
00:03:53,423 --> 00:03:56,063
Go home and sleep, you didn't left last night!

46
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:57,398
No, I'm sorry.

47
00:03:57,493 --> 00:04:00,140
There are a lot of things I have to do here.

48
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:02,923
That's enough, Sam, I've received

49
00:04:03,064 --> 00:04:05,243
another report from the Duke!

50
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:06,415
What is it?

51
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,493
He said he would postpone
the closure of the mine!

52
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,946
You can now continue
to investigate this matter!

53
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:14,688
O-oh?

54
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,250
The owner will pay for these things!

55
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:21,571
He will also pay salaries to all, as usual!

56
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:24,020
But the talk that I had with him...

57
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:27,340
What is it, Sam? Shouldn't you rejoice now?

58
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:29,820
I'm sure the pressure is not on you!

59
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,759
Oh...

60
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:37,563
However, what makes the wind
suddenly change its way?

61
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:40,829
Don't bother about it now!
Thank you!

62
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:43,210
Please wait a little here.

63
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:43,986
Okay!

64
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,103
Oh?

65
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,410
Ah, be silent!

66
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,590
- How long will you keep barking like this?
<i>- Lassie!</i>

67
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,477
Why is it in there?

68
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,704
<i>You should be ashamed of what you did!</i>

69
00:04:58,134 --> 00:04:59,540
What are you talking about?

70
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:01,024
It's Lassie!

71
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:03,189
You talked to my son

72
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,321
to take the dog that he cared so much for!

73
00:05:06,462 --> 00:05:07,985
<i>This is a very cowardly act!</i>

74
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,696
Sam, calm down! Sam...

75
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:16,228
That boy is very conscious,

76
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:20,798
and doesn't do such foolish things!

77
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:25,065
Also John, as a man, made a promise to me!

78
00:05:25,173 --> 00:05:26,800
What do you mean, as a man?

79
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:29,157
He's only 11 years old!

80
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:30,840
So what?

81
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:35,196
Can't you trust your son's word?

82
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:39,290
Or don't you trust yourself?

83
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,673
What do you mean by that?

84
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,540
John trusts you so much.

85
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,149
He still thinks that coal will come out

86
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:50,658
exactly as you told him!

87
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,070
Your son has agreed, because
he trusts you, Mr. Carraclough.

88
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,001
Did you understand the calculation?
2 multiply by 4 equals 8!

89
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:09,050
4 multiply by 5 equals 20,
and 4 multiply by 1 equals 4.

90
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:14,593
xxx

91
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:16,618
Ah... Strange...

92
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:18,695
Today is John acting strange...

93
00:06:19,483 --> 00:06:20,304
John...

94
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:29,444
This is all we studied for today!

95
00:06:29,562 --> 00:06:30,898
John Carraclough!

96
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:33,429
<i>John Carraclough!</i>

97
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:35,413
Yes!

98
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:40,085
Today you should listen like the other
children and gather information!

99
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,663
Y-y-yes... i-i-information?

100
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:43,670
Oh...!

101
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,802
Carraclough!

102
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:49,833
Throughout the day you thought to other things!

103
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:51,746
I-I'm sorry...

104
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:53,715
In this case, you'll see!

105
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:57,820
Lassie will laugh at you when it salutes you!

106
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:02,326
Eh?

107
00:07:02,536 --> 00:07:03,919
Lassie came here?

108
00:07:07,638 --> 00:07:08,575
Lassie!

109
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:10,700
John!

110
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:11,545
Ah!

111
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:13,114
Lassie!

112
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:17,310
Lassie...

113
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,670
You...

114
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,670
Why did you come back, Lassie?

115
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,318
Later on we'll talk with the Duke.

116
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,958
Ah, you are here as I expected!

117
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,450
You have been well trained how
to escape quickly, it's so stunning!

118
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:48,435
Lassie escaped from the palace?

119
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:50,510
Tell me straight!

120
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:53,433
Didn't it learn to escape from the beginning?

121
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,232
No way!

122
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:58,920
You sold the dog at a high price even though you
know it won't stay with anyone else, isn't it?

123
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,659
What a smart plan!

124
00:08:00,684 --> 00:08:03,018
You know me, I'm Heinz, you can't fool me!

125
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,980
It's wrong! I'm not like that!

126
00:08:05,606 --> 00:08:07,276
Don't you want to go now?

127
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:08,590
Wait a moment!

128
00:08:09,332 --> 00:08:11,317
Lassie... I'm sorry!

129
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:15,153
But I must keep my promise to the Duke!

130
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,340
I will definitely be able to recover you!

131
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:19,348
Hm!

132
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:21,012
And now, come!

133
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:30,030
John!

134
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:31,731
What happened to Lassie?

135
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:32,356
Hm!

136
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,540
Nothing at all!

137
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,028
It will come back quick!

138
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,075
I just agreed with Priscilla's grandfather!

139
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:40,320
You agree with him...

140
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:41,020
Yes!

141
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,800
Priscilla loves dogs a lot!

142
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:47,675
But is it okay to let Lassie go alone?

143
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,317
It will be fine, it will be back soon!

144
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:51,723
Where are you going?

145
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,237
To the mine!

146
00:08:53,262 --> 00:08:54,536
I will help my father!

147
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:58,152
But the mine is closed now...

148
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,333
- Ah!
- Eh?

149
00:09:00,155 --> 00:09:01,450
<i>It's moving!</i>

150
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,010
I will help you, Dad.

151
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,166
I must do everything I can!

152
00:09:53,682 --> 00:09:55,280
Excuse me, manager...

153
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,190
John?

154
00:09:56,526 --> 00:09:59,554
Ah...! Kids can't enter here!

155
00:09:59,643 --> 00:10:02,190
I want to help you bring out coal!

156
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:03,580
What did you say?

157
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:05,618
Oh! No, get back quickly!

158
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:06,971
- Manager!
- Eh?

159
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,252
Please let him come here!

160
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:10,885
I'll talk to him!

161
00:10:10,932 --> 00:10:11,565
Eh...

162
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,424
Thank you!

163
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,041
Father, I...

164
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,291
Can you help me here?

165
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:26,385
Dad, I want to do anything!

166
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:30,182
Father?

167
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:34,448
We must drill deeper.

168
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:37,580
Now I collect samples for each of these rocks.

169
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,220
It's hard to dig throuh this soil, though.

170
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,119
There is one thing you can do!

171
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:46,393
<i>Use this to collect rock samples.</i>

172
00:10:46,642 --> 00:10:47,838
Father!

173
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,744
Let us do our best to extract coal!

174
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:51,581
John!

175
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:52,987
Yes!

176
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,299
This is for Lassie too.

177
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,541
Father, that is...

178
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:01,002
Ian!

179
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,463
Yes!

180
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:04,893
I will!

181
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,432
Mr. Carraclough, is it reasonable
to let your son do that?

182
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,377
No, but this time I have to let him do it!

183
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,720
<i>You will become a pig if you fall!</i>

184
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,464
Whoa!

185
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,766
What is that?

186
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:08,836
My house is full of strange men!

187
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:21,391
John!

188
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:30,242
Lassie...

189
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:33,010
Haven't come yet...

190
00:12:38,031 --> 00:12:38,898
John...

191
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:44,470
You can't!

192
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,460
If you run away I will shoot you!

193
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,037
I'm the one who did it!

194
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:52,530
So you can't make any hole!

195
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,187
<i>Be careful, it's hot!</i>

196
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:12,609
Please!

197
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,398
I feel a bit strange about this thing.

198
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:24,342
I think the Duke has something in his mind.

199
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:26,922
He decided to return to
Scotland all of a sudden!

200
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:28,024
Hm?

201
00:13:28,835 --> 00:13:30,133
If that's so, Lassie...

202
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,617
Could also Lassie...

203
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,891
Don't be silly!

204
00:13:35,008 --> 00:13:37,385
You have to drill without thinking
about other things!

205
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:39,845
We have to prove to the Duke what we can do!

206
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:40,809
Probably...

207
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:43,675
If coal doesn't come out I won't
be able to buy food for him!

208
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:47,921
I mean, your wife is pregnant, eh?

209
00:13:47,946 --> 00:13:51,310
So... If coal doesn't come out, it will die!

210
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:53,120
I can't even buy milk!

211
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:54,907
<i>This is the father's responsibility!</i>

212
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:57,020
<i>- Do your best!
- Yes!</i>

213
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:59,172
My responsability...

214
00:14:09,907 --> 00:14:10,766
John!

215
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,039
Will you go to the mine today?

216
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:14,368
I'm sorry!

217
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:17,704
I haven't played with you lately, but...

218
00:14:17,797 --> 00:14:20,766
John, will Lassie go to Scotland?

219
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:21,352
Eh?

220
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,696
My father heard this from some people!

221
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:27,633
Today they will send it with the plane!

222
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:31,250
They told us there was no need
to send food to the dog tomorrow.

223
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,485
I'm sure that Lassie...

224
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:36,938
Tell me, can't we get
Lassie back before it leaves?

225
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,413
Now we can't!

226
00:14:40,438 --> 00:14:41,186
John!

227
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:42,680
What does that mean?

228
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:47,110
We can get Lassie back when coal comes out!

229
00:14:47,243 --> 00:14:48,758
Sorry, I have to go!

230
00:14:48,914 --> 00:14:50,961
There's a lot I have to do!

231
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,438
John!

232
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,360
I see.

233
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,800
We will send these samples
to the laboratory for analysis!

234
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:02,539
Yes!

235
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,891
We need to know how many layers are displayed!

236
00:15:05,297 --> 00:15:07,655
This place is called Old Coal Life.

237
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,774
Although it is a very old layer.

238
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,547
<i>However, when we know
the default age of the layers,</i>

239
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:15,823
<i>we could find coal more easily!</i>

240
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,040
Yes!

241
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,571
Somehow you are better than me in this area!

242
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:22,383
No...

243
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,110
I will send it by mail!

244
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,950
Yes, I count on you!

245
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,492
John the selfish!

246
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,770
You'll travel two days by train,
it was comfortable in Yorkshire, right?

247
00:16:21,006 --> 00:16:22,266
<i>Oh, Heinz!</i>

248
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,990
It's been a long time!

249
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,810
Have you brought with you a new animal?

250
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:26,852
Yes!

251
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,680
I brought it from the remote Yorkshire!

252
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,270
My grandfather ​​really likes dogs.

253
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,500
Is it a good type?

254
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:39,230
Ah, you can see that very soon, Miss!

255
00:16:39,938 --> 00:16:40,751
Ah!

256
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,711
Lassie!

257
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:46,153
This is the boy called John.

258
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:48,085
He is a good boy!

259
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:49,960
He decided to take responsibility

260
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:54,415
and give me Lassie without crying.

261
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:55,790
Priscilla...

262
00:16:55,936 --> 00:16:58,460
I strongly acknowledge the will of that boy,

263
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:01,100
but if the coal doesn't come down,
Lassie will be mine!

264
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:03,150
It will be yours?

265
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,030
<i>Priscilla!</i>

266
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:09,766
I think I'll be back if I can!

267
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,461
But don't you think it's rude
to reunite John and Lassie

268
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,329
suddenly after we agreed?

269
00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:18,930
<i>John!</i>

270
00:17:19,796 --> 00:17:20,656
Mail!

271
00:17:20,696 --> 00:17:23,508
Dad said I should bring it off!

272
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,415
Please read it quickly!

273
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:28,829
Don't you rush so!

274
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:31,782
How were the results of the analyzes?

275
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:33,844
Don't you rush so!

276
00:17:40,704 --> 00:17:42,047
What is the matter?

277
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:43,399
We have not succeeded!

278
00:17:43,424 --> 00:17:44,087
Eh?

279
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:44,907
Oh?

280
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:48,415
Coal is not under that layer.

281
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:52,704
There is a possibility that the result is zero.

282
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:55,727
It is rare that the result is zero!

283
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:56,749
I don't believe!

284
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:57,620
If...

285
00:17:57,711 --> 00:17:59,251
- Can't be that...
- John!

286
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:00,580
<i>Lassie...</i>

287
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,376
Won't it be back yet?

288
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:06,235
John, be quiet!

289
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:08,577
I can't be quiet!

290
00:18:08,602 --> 00:18:09,790
John, please wait!

291
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:12,126
Not only John...

292
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:13,961
We're all shocked...

293
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:16,508
Manager!

294
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:42,079
Lassie...

295
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,891
Lassie...

296
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,860
John?

297
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:23,118
John!

298
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:27,047
Colin and Sandy told me I'd find you here.

299
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,290
They were sure you are here.

300
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:34,141
This is your special place!

301
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,735
John, and Colin, and Sandy!

302
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,024
Miss Priscilla...

303
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,001
And also Lassie... father...

304
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:46,149
Ah!

305
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:49,102
I understood, also Lassie...!

306
00:19:57,841 --> 00:19:59,266
Now... let's go!

307
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,993
Outside, others are waiting for you.

308
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,759
Waiting for me?

309
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,985
John!

310
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,884
Sandy...  Colin!

311
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:12,509
John the fool!

312
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:15,673
You don't have to think about it yourself!

313
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,423
Now let's go home!

314
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:23,290
Mother is also waiting for us, John.

315
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:24,712
<i>Yes!</i>

316
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,485
Why is Lassie inside on such iron sheets?

317
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:34,642
Huh! Uh... uh...

318
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,680
No, in fact we put these so it won't escape!

319
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:39,610
Escape?

320
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:40,640
Ah... Yes-yes!

321
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:42,921
This is the best way I did

322
00:20:42,946 --> 00:20:45,930
after it escaped from the Yorkshire
mansion several times!

323
00:20:46,031 --> 00:20:48,800
No, of course it've been trained on this!

324
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,100
He got a lot of money after selling it to someone
else, and he knew he would run away again!

325
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,917
That's why I thought of this!

326
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,425
John couldn't think of something like that!

327
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:03,604
If Lassie is still waiting for John's return,
it can't remain silent!

328
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:05,290
It don't want to be patient!

329
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:06,479
I can't bear it!

330
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:11,947
John... even John wants to see
Lassie without a doubt!

331
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:15,409
My grandfather doesn't understand anything!

332
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:16,535
Eh... ah... whoa!

333
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,995
Miss, what are you doing?

334
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,135
Lassie!

335
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,675
Do you want to go to John's place?

336
00:21:23,854 --> 00:21:24,948
You can go!

337
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:28,315
Whoa! Oh-ah-ah!

338
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,830
I can't believe!

339
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,814
