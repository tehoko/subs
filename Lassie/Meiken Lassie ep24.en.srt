1
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,930
My grandfather doesn't understand anything!

2
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,810
Oh! Miss, what are you doing?

3
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:29,906
Lassie!

4
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,422
Do you want to go to John's place?

5
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:35,560
You can go!

6
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:38,860
Eh-ah-ah-ah!

7
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,130
Don't open the door!

8
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,820
No, but open it!

9
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:47,899
Ah...!

10
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,319
What does that mean?

11
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:56,539
Let it go to John!

12
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,960
UNKNOWN PLACES. SEARCH FOR LASSIE

13
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,530
Do you understand what you have done?

14
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:10,297
Yes... of course!

15
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,071
Huh!

16
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:14,086
This will discredit our family!

17
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:17,258
You only have to recognize what you have done!

18
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,640
Even if that dog knows the location
of the village of Greenor Bridge...

19
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,477
But now it's in Scotland,
which is 400 miles away!

20
00:02:26,804 --> 00:02:28,241
This is ridiculous!

21
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:32,624
<i>You've just left the dog mess around!</i>

22
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:35,093
Mess around? What a terrible analogy!

23
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,120
<i>No matter if this is the promise
that John made to you,</i>

24
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,387
<i>you should've thought about Lassie!</i>

25
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,170
Even if that is promise that men do.

26
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:48,975
Didn't you thought about what would happen
if the coal didn't come out again?

27
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,420
As you said, exactly.

28
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,827
So what will you do for John and Lassie?

29
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:58,944
I don't want to be separated because of us!

30
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,623
Grandfather, in the end
you wanted to own Lassie!

31
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:06,342
Priscilla...

32
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,264
Lassie may face many people
who want to own it too.

33
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,733
I understand very well how
your heart feels about that dog.

34
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:19,202
But we can't guarantee that some
honorable people will pick it up.

35
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:24,428
Well well... It's better to hope
that Lassie will have good luck!

36
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,888
- Look, Willy!
- Huh?

37
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:37,178
<i>Eh, it looks like a good dog!</i>

38
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,293
This is a wonderful dog!

39
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,881
I wonder why it hangs around
in a place like this?

40
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:42,553
Uh?

41
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:43,553
What do you mean?

42
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,510
Aren't you well?

43
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:52,058
It would be great to stay with us!

44
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,371
Come on... just come...

45
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:56,099
Don't run!

46
00:03:56,295 --> 00:04:00,138
There is no need to fear and stay still

47
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,459
Well, you're good!

48
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,115
Now are you ready?

49
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:06,834
- Willie!
- Yes!

50
00:04:07,326 --> 00:04:07,920
Ah...!

51
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:09,607
Wait

52
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,280
He must be a runaway from the Duke's house!

53
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:16,888
Where is it hiding?

54
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:20,951
If we catch that dog we'll get a great bonus!

55
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:25,536
Damn, he must be hiding here!

56
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:26,513
Ah! It's there!

57
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:27,170
Uh!

58
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,010
Ay! Don't throw the stone!

59
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,881
We don't want to wound it!

60
00:04:31,997 --> 00:04:33,520
But we won't catch it!

61
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:34,248
Eh?

62
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,115
Hm!

63
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:40,320
Eh? A message? For me?

64
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,150
From who?

65
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,591
Guess who?

66
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,036
Stop joking and tell me!

67
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,107
Here.

68
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:52,700
Priscilla Rodoring?

69
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:56,316
Ah, from Scotland! It's from Priscilla!

70
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,817
What about Lassie?

71
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:05,583
Lassie...

72
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:08,458
It fled from their palace in Scotland.

73
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:09,544
Eh?

74
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,124
<i>It left the palace...</i>

75
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:13,950
He went directly south...

76
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:17,052
Someone saw Lassie walking south!

77
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,138
<i>To the South...</i>

78
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:30,200
It says the South!

79
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,390
If it will go south, it will
reach Yorkshire, Mom!

80
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:38,872
Lassie returns home!

81
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,220
Just a moment, John!

82
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,245
Okay I'll go!

83
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,255
Just a moment, John!

84
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,250
We must find coal in any way!

85
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,489
Lassie goes home, so I won't
let it go anywhere else!

86
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:50,888
I'll do my best!

87
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,731
John...

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,560
What do you do, teacher?

89
00:06:17,771 --> 00:06:18,488
Well...

90
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:21,430
I'm only a fan of Loch Ness!

91
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:23,316
I wish the monster would appear again!

92
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,240
This place is suitable
for drawing pictures...

93
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,974
Well...

94
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:29,740
It's a bit interesting...!

95
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,260
This...

96
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:33,005
Don't you see it there?

97
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,138
<i>Still looking at the lake.</i>

98
00:06:36,455 --> 00:06:37,150
Eh...

99
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:39,632
<i>That dog looks so precious.</i>

100
00:06:39,657 --> 00:06:42,490
It seems to want to go to
the far side of the lake.

101
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,006
You are like the poets!

102
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:53,600
Oh?

103
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,490
What is it doing?

104
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:09,160
Maybe it wants to cross the lake!

105
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:10,241
Eh?

106
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,858
Somehow the dog did it...!

107
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,529
I wonder why it went across this lake?

108
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:26,967
I don't know...

109
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:31,061
<i>I'm sure there's something precious about it.</i>

110
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,007
Yes...

111
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,733
Me too...

112
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:15,983
Even if I were alone I could do it!

113
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,660
<i>Then Jimmy ate everything!</i>

114
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,287
<i>So funny!</i>

115
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,967
<i>Did Jimmy eat at last?</i>

116
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,076
<i>This is true!</i>

117
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,320
<i>Take it!</i>

118
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,238
You don't have to hesitate...

119
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,130
You have to eat and you'll be comfortable!

120
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:07,504
And now take it all!

121
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,519
It's stubborn.

122
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,430
It's okay.

123
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,010
<i>John, I have published
this ad in the newspaper.</i>

124
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,542
<i>Anyone who sees this beautiful Collie dog ​
may contact me for a reward.</i>

125
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:36,089
Oh?

126
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:43,042
Yes, is it similar to what was
published in the newspaper?

127
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,925
Where is it now?

128
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:46,097
Yes!

129
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,230
<i>I noticed that Lassie was
heading south directly.</i>

130
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:55,112
<i>No, it is heading straight to London.</i>

131
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,214
<i>John...</i>

132
00:09:57,394 --> 00:10:01,964
Lassie... continues to travel to your city.

133
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:04,820
The picture I sent...

134
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:08,495
It's from Loch Ness in Scotland,
it was standing in that exact spot!

135
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,659
Lassie...

136
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:32,370
No, let's get away from this dog!

137
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,323
Ya-ah!

138
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:57,448
<i>xxx</i>

139
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,588
I found you, you dirty dog!

140
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:18,787
It may be harmful!

141
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,699
Hey, come on!

142
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,911
What it did this suddenly?

143
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,786
He suddenly became calm.

144
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,395
<i>Well, get it in the car quickly!</i>

145
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:57,333
Oh! It's there!

146
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,380
Whoa!

147
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,917
What is that?

148
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:09,833
He fled into the court!

149
00:12:11,554 --> 00:12:14,060
Now go to the defendant!

150
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:16,146
Whoa!

151
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,685
What is that? It come here to watch?

152
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:22,735
Oh!

153
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,645
I apologize, I'll catch it now!

154
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,310
Oh! Oh!

155
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,130
Oh!

156
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:28,451
<i>Oh...!</i>

157
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,153
Damn, what a dog!

158
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,360
<i>Father, in there!</i>

159
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,040
Damn, the sheep will be attacked again!

160
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,908
<i>There's another one!</i>

161
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,517
- Are you sure?
- I don't know...

162
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,024
It may be your imagination!

163
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:48,460
It's not like that!

164
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,471
I heard a voice behind the house!

165
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,650
Something seems to be suffering terribly...

166
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:56,517
I didn't hear any sound!

167
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:05,210
Oh! What is this thing?

168
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,549
What is the matter?

169
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:09,010
Come and see! It's a big dog!

170
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,713
Who did all this?

171
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,900
Poor thing...

172
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:20,930
Hm... This wound is made by gun.

173
00:14:21,048 --> 00:14:23,673
Shot this dog with a gun?

174
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,470
Last week I got Tommy's mail
from the neighboring town.

175
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,410
In that place the sheep were attacked.

176
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,108
I heard from the owners of the barn
complaining about it.

177
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,370
If this dog attacked the sheep...

178
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:39,468
Hm...

179
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,225
<i>It's not so, Dan.</i>

180
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:46,910
This dog can't attack the sheep!

181
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,660
Is this how you feel again?

182
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,760
Sometimes you make a mistake!

183
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,007
But you also agree with me!

184
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,478
Didn't we move to this house because of that?

185
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,540
Hm? Well maybe...

186
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,126
<i>John!</i>

187
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,555
<i>Haven't you wake up yet?</i>

188
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:27,085
<i>Breakfast is ready!</i>

189
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:29,298
<i>Okay, I'm coming!</i>

190
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,884
<b>Lassie came from upstairs
to the kitchen ahead of you!</b>

191
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,290
<b>What?</b>

192
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:37,181
<i>Say something like that...</i>

193
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,931
<i>Lassie is lazy...</i>

194
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:42,806
How are you now?

195
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:45,876
I brought you warm milk!

196
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,415
Do you feed it with milk?

197
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,392
There is nothing wrong with
breakfast sometimes with milk!

198
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,925
My God! My God!

199
00:15:56,084 --> 00:15:59,115
It is rare for an English man
to drink tea instead of milk!

200
00:15:59,255 --> 00:16:02,177
I think I'm the only one complaining here!

201
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:07,051
<i>Oh...!</i>

202
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:09,010
<i>You can stand now!</i>

203
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,787
Four days have already passed!

204
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:16,090
Dear, close the door immediately!

205
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:17,755
Purcell will come out!

206
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,748
Oh!

207
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,140
Purcell!

208
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:23,745
You are barely able to walk!

209
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,326
You still have more time!

210
00:16:28,347 --> 00:16:29,568
However...

211
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,677
Danny went to war.

212
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:37,123
When we left, no one else stayed at home.

213
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:41,199
You are also satisfied with Purcell's presence.

214
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:41,965
Eh?

215
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,996
I suddenly became like you!

216
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,300
<i>He will be fine!</i>

217
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,527
<i>Purcell went far beyond the war.</i>

218
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:52,910
<i>This is impossible to return again.</i>

219
00:16:52,935 --> 00:16:54,445
<i>Hm... This is true!</i>

220
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:58,535
<i>This picture was taken a week ago in court.</i>

221
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,918
<i>After that, I don't know where Lassie is.</i>

222
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:03,455
<i>But I'm sure it is in good health!</i>

223
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,674
It will continue his journey
until it reaches you!

224
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:08,424
Lassie...

225
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:11,065
Where did you go?

226
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:25,838
Purcell!

227
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,041
<i>Don't open the door, Dan!</i>

228
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:32,409
Hm? Oh?

229
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,674
Purcell, you can't go out now.

230
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,010
Your wound has not healed yet.

231
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:41,291
Purcell...

232
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,612
Don't make us sad for you.

233
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,229
If you have more health,
you will be very sad.

234
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:53,315
Isn't it?

235
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,213
Shall I enter please?

236
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,112
My dear, it's okay now!

237
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,000
Today too?

238
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:07,254
Yes, he always does that at three o'clock.

239
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:08,136
Hm...

240
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:11,838
<i>What is he aiming for at three o'clock?</i>

241
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,190
Somehow we don't see it anymore, do we?

242
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,252
Listen John!

243
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:26,395
It will certainly come soon!

244
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:30,040
Lassie will definitely sit
next time there, right?

245
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:31,925
Yes.

246
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,463
That's it!

247
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,563
Purcell? Isn't it right?

248
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,479
Purcell... you...

249
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:18,050
I have a feeling that oatmeal
this morning is a bit different.

250
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:22,807
<i>Dan!</i>

251
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,498
Hm? What is the matter?

252
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,659
It may not be happy here.

253
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:30,948
Hm?

254
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,100
Did you notice only at this time?

255
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,040
It's not like I didn't notice!

256
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:37,205
I knew that.

257
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,276
You care about it a lot!

258
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,198
Even if Purcell's eyes are nice,
but his eyes are still very sad!

259
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:52,182
It was like Danny's return when he was young.

260
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:54,127
Maybe you're right.

261
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,916
<i>Why don't we let Purcell go?</i>

262
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,520
<i>When Danny was little,
he loved walking in the forest.</i>

263
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,512
But Purcell has hurt his leg not long ago!

264
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:11,849
You know very well that
its injury has become much better!

265
00:20:12,615 --> 00:20:15,951
When it comes out of here
it won't come back again.

266
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:18,709
Do you think the same?

267
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,076
<i>It seems to be traveling to a certain place.</i>

268
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:27,865
<i>This house is just a passing place.</i>

269
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,591
Perhaps we can do it with our hands gently.

270
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:33,029
He didn't go anywhere.

271
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:36,677
<i>We may hurt it more without knowing.</i>

272
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:40,787
But it will be okay, right?

273
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:44,427
We also lived a long life.

274
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:45,943
Yes.

275
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,160
It might come back to us, wouldn't it?

276
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:52,080
Before Purcell came

277
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,498
I will continue to live happily with you.

278
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:56,638
Yes!

279
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,013
No doubt about it!

280
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,576
Come, Purcell!

281
00:21:10,794 --> 00:21:14,498
No, you really have a name, don't you?

282
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,935
Now go where you want!

283
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,068
Be careful!

284
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,725
No, just go!

285
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:35,701
Also be happy!

286
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,224
This is true, this is the most important thing!

287
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,154
It's happy now, isn't it?

288
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:49,380
That 's true!

289
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,318
<i>It was back in the mine after
we discovered something!</i>

290
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:07,685
<i>But I don't know yet where Lassie is.</i>

291
00:22:08,888 --> 00:22:10,083
<i>Do your best, Lassie!</i>

292
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:12,060
<i>I will definitely find you!</i>

293
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,050
<i>Next episode:
WELCOME BACK, LASSIE</i>

294
00:22:15,177 --> 00:22:16,474
<i>Be sure to watch!</i>
