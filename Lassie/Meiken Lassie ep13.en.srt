1
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:27,420
SANDY STEALS COWS?

2
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:31,364
Like this you won't depend on me!

3
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,663
What? Didn't you go?

4
00:01:40,053 --> 00:01:41,110
I have homeworks!

5
00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:44,249
My God! My God!

6
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,366
I see.

7
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:53,327
You want milk.

8
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,641
I apologize for walking all this distance, but...

9
00:01:58,563 --> 00:01:59,953
You know, Lassie...

10
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:02,563
I can't give you milk today.

11
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:10,434
Hm?

12
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:22,765
Look!

13
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:24,772
There's no milk!

14
00:02:24,899 --> 00:02:25,523
Eh?

15
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,054
I thought it would be okay
when I relied on Lassie...

16
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,273
Hm?

17
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,910
What is that?

18
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:33,179
A message?

19
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,155
What?

20
00:02:34,374 --> 00:02:36,600
The milk has been ended.

21
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,377
But that huge cow...

22
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,334
The milk placed in the soup would taste better.

23
00:02:44,451 --> 00:02:46,090
We have no other choice.

24
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,022
What? Where are you going?

25
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:49,889
To Sandy's house!

26
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:53,843
Hm?

27
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,389
<i>What will he do with his homework?</i>

28
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,440
That's great!

29
00:03:04,595 --> 00:03:06,790
The cow is fine!

30
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:07,384
Yes!

31
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,258
I thought she was dead!

32
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:11,368
No.

33
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,532
But...

34
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:16,330
It can give milk when it eats well!

35
00:03:16,547 --> 00:03:17,368
But...

36
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:18,360
But?

37
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,008
Mm, no longer give any drop of milk.

38
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:22,915
Eh?

39
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:25,650
Don't it give milk when it eats well?

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,509
This...

41
00:03:28,782 --> 00:03:31,094
A veal tries to suck without caring!

42
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,961
<i>It can't drink other than its milk.</i>

43
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,850
<i>Mother's milk is its favorite!</i>

44
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,924
<i>We have no other choice.</i>

45
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,151
Ah...

46
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,369
Dad, aren't you thinking the same thing?

47
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,611
It's better to be more kind...

48
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,640
There's nothing we can do!

49
00:04:20,713 --> 00:04:22,744
You have to reach any convincing result!

50
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:26,431
Dear, if you shout aloud
our children will wake up!

51
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:31,371
Ah... children are children...

52
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:35,713
That cow is Sandy's favorite.

53
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:39,615
<i>She also learned how to milk cow's milk.</i>

54
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:40,590
<i>Ah...</i>

55
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,140
Sandy is very happy with her.

56
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,256
It's enough! Stop this talk!

57
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,270
<i>I also worked hard for her!</i>

58
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,560
No, that...

59
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:53,575
So you have to find some way!

60
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:56,567
Dad, are you weak in front of these things?

61
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,680
It's not like that.

62
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,380
The cow is not like pets!

63
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,919
If it does not help, we won't need it!

64
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,590
If we don't get milk,
we will not benefit from it!

65
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:06,214
Eh...

66
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,278
<i>So...</i>

67
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:10,278
I'll take it to the village.

68
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:11,786
<i>Okay.</i>

69
00:05:12,002 --> 00:05:15,965
It's better to do that when Sandy
goes to school... okay?

70
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,739
What to do? What to do? What to do?

71
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:51,731
Oh?

72
00:05:58,867 --> 00:05:59,880
Good morning!

73
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:01,903
Yes, good morning.

74
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:03,605
But, is that the truth?

75
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,560
Uh?

76
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:06,427
I heard of the presence of a thief.

77
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,145
What, a thief?

78
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,427
That's it.

79
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,352
xxx

80
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,718
The cow of my kind daughter has been stolen!

81
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:24,929
I don't forgive the cause of this concern!

82
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,775
How can you be sure there was a thief?

83
00:06:28,893 --> 00:06:32,260
There was a lock on the outside!

84
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,252
What do you think of opening it?

85
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:39,030
Or do you think the cow
opened the lock and ran away?

86
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:41,918
No, I can't even imagine it.

87
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,160
Don't laugh!

88
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,180
Next time I will find a cow thief no matter
if I search inside your home!

89
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:55,019
But if there is no thief you will put
yourself in an awkward position.

90
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:57,066
This happened to me earlier.

91
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,488
He stole from us two cows!

92
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,432
We must arrest him and punish him!

93
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:04,379
<i>Is it good to let this bad person go free?</i>

94
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,480
It's not easy for me.

95
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:11,714
Well you found it! You found
any evidence and told me!

96
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,839
I won't cooperate with you!

97
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,809
Well, his saying is true.

98
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,325
He doesn't have any evidence.

99
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,460
We can't help him like that!

100
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:21,340
Damn!

101
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,348
Sandy, that's a problem, isn't it?

102
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,489
I'm worried.

103
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,645
This is better for my father.

104
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:31,482
Eh?

105
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:36,223
I'm worried about what he's thinking!

106
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,494
What a subject he wants to sell my father.

107
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:40,299
Eh?

108
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,970
What does that mean?

109
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:44,104
- Oh...
- Oh...

110
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,190
<i>Eh...</i>

111
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:52,213
Henry VII, took the subject of religiosity
in the country more seriously.

112
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:56,611
So he firmly believed that the war would work.

113
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,404
Henry VII entered northern
and southern Scotland...

114
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:07,240
Damn...!

115
00:08:08,147 --> 00:08:09,147
Ah...!

116
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,920
I don't care if no one cooperates with me!

117
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:29,105
<i>Sandy!</i>

118
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,700
If you want any help from us, let us know!

119
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:33,774
Right!

120
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,477
Oh really?

121
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,813
Do you really want to help me?

122
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:40,289
Yes!

123
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:42,270
The weather is very cold.

124
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:44,230
Maybe I can't help you very much.

125
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:46,860
Don't you want to tell you a secret?

126
00:08:47,016 --> 00:08:48,000
A secret?

127
00:08:49,302 --> 00:08:50,336
What did you say?

128
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:51,470
Yes.

129
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,696
Well I'll tell you.

130
00:08:54,844 --> 00:08:56,227
It's a very important secret!

131
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:57,399
Eh?

132
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,347
Oh!

133
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:25,072
John! Colin!

134
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:27,238
Um?

135
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:30,596
Don't tell anyone.

136
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,487
Sandy, what's up?

137
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:36,331
You are not Sandy we know!

138
00:09:36,462 --> 00:09:38,861
Die if you tell! Okay?

139
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:40,433
I-I swear!

140
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:41,142
Yes.

141
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:42,073
Me too.

142
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:43,450
Oh...

143
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:51,567
Now I'll tell you about
my most important secret!

144
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,498
Yes.

145
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:56,614
Oh?

146
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:01,669
Oh!

147
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,638
It's the voice of the cow!

148
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,292
Could it be that cow?

149
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:07,430
Wait! Listen to me first!

150
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:09,192
But the thief...

151
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:09,873
Uh...

152
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,946
The thief...

153
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:15,970
It's me.

154
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:16,736
Eh?

155
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,535
You also expected this will end very bad.

156
00:10:37,848 --> 00:10:38,457
Yes.

157
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,941
But I had no choice.

158
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,394
What are you going to do from now on?

159
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:48,855
I never thought of that.

160
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,480
I also can't think of anything.

161
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,394
It's better to tell your father, Sandy.

162
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,370
I won't do it!

163
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,636
My father can never help

164
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,222
so he didn't find any reason to feed it!

165
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,556
We can't do anything without
finding a suitable idea!

166
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,728
Let's think about it ourselves!

167
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,681
So we find a good idea!

168
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:11,790
What if we find no good idea?

169
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:13,439
We will find a good idea!

170
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:15,931
We will definitely find a good idea!

171
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:16,681
Yes.

172
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:17,791
Yes.

173
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,328
Isn't it, Lassie?

174
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:25,218
The weather is good!

175
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,148
It's okay to stay out!

176
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:31,830
I have to be a little happier!

177
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:34,429
Eh...

178
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:35,781
Is that so?

179
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:36,375
Eh...

180
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,054
<i>Oh...</i>

181
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,476
<i>Will the milk come out if we pull it like this?</i>

182
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:41,827
Yes, it must happen but...

183
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,702
We have done this several times.

184
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,413
Let's do our best!

185
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:47,063
Yes!

186
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,656
<i>Oh...</i>

187
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,110
What is it?

188
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:06,591
Hear its voice?

189
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:08,874
Yeah, there are some people with it!

190
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,390
Okay!

191
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,435
That's it!

192
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,341
This is the biggest proof
of the thief's existence!

193
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:25,334
Banson will take us there!

194
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,349
But that's just...

195
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:30,599
This is bad!

196
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,896
Let's do something!

197
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,677
What? What does that mean?

198
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,630
Aren't you sure?

199
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:39,250
Oh, I was drunk a bit at that time...

200
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:40,864
Uh...

201
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:43,100
It might be something else!

202
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:44,403
That's great!

203
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:47,036
This is our chance to take the cow away!

204
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:47,669
Yes!

205
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:54,515
Wait a moment!

206
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:56,789
Me?

207
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,624
There is work to be done!

208
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:00,305
- Eh!
- Oh!

209
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:04,147
I want you to go with Banson and all of us!

210
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:05,224
Eh! Oh...

211
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:07,085
<i>Is there any objection?</i>

212
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:08,820
<i>No other choice!</i>

213
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:10,156
<i>Let's do it!</i>

214
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,529
Sandy, wait!

215
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:17,914
If we don't hurry up,
people will arrive before us!

216
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,960
Let's hurry up!

217
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:21,828
We must catch the thief before he escapes us!

218
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:23,757
Is the thief really there?

219
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,234
For some reason the situation has reversed...

220
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:29,195
Hey, all of you hasten more!

221
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:31,351
Colin! Faster!

222
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:38,992
Moo, I'm sorry!

223
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,225
I must take you somewhere else!

224
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:42,671
And now hurry up!

225
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,070
Moo!

226
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,124
Is this the right way? Haven't you mistaken?

227
00:13:58,264 --> 00:13:59,834
Yeah, maybe...

228
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,489
Lassie...

229
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,150
It's not good to stay here, is it?

230
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,190
What's the matter, Moo?

231
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,942
She won't move...!

232
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,966
Well, listen, Lassie.

233
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,653
Let's do it in the right place.

234
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,598
<i>Look!</i>

235
00:14:26,044 --> 00:14:27,513
There's something here which seems lost!

236
00:14:27,622 --> 00:14:29,091
Is it with?

237
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,080
No, no...

238
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,793
This is mine.

239
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,442
Yesterday I dropped it here.

240
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,778
How does a drunk like you forget
the most important thing he has?

241
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,590
This is not the time to laugh!

242
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,169
Everyone shouldn't take eyes off him!

243
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:45,614
Is it near?

244
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,325
I think so.

245
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,841
From that way? Or where?

246
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,692
No, but from there...?

247
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,580
But there...

248
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,434
In here!

249
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,489
It seems that Lassie has found something!

250
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,833
Isn't it, Lassie?

251
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,216
Ah...!

252
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:02,692
Well done, John!

253
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:04,036
In here! In here!

254
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,555
<i>Everyone goes in a different way!</i>

255
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,570
John did it!

256
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,617
This is our chance, quick!

257
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:15,460
Let's go from here, Moo!

258
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,843
Don't do that, Lassie!

259
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,546
We have to drag them to another road!

260
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:38,825
Moo!

261
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,190
Please!

262
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:42,965
If we stay here, my father will find us!

263
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,540
Moo, do you understand that?

264
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,957
What will happen to you?

265
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,270
As I expected, she can't
understand our feelings.

266
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:58,356
Is not so, is that right, Moo?

267
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:00,035
Moo's baby...

268
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,754
Hey, if we go this way...

269
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,285
- Eh?
- John, wait a moment!

270
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:09,841
Eh?

271
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,145
There is no way out in this direction!

272
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:13,903
Eh...

273
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,200
Don't know if the thief
went this way on a wire.

274
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:26,150
But the cow and its baby
can't cross this river.

275
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,884
Isn't it better to go back
to the previous place?

276
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:31,541
Uh?

277
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:33,321
John...

278
00:16:33,978 --> 00:16:34,775
Eh...

279
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:36,955
Oh!

280
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,902
In here!

281
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,121
All of you follow me!

282
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,895
Don't go back to this way, Lassie!

283
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:58,140
What is the matter?

284
00:16:58,223 --> 00:17:00,348
That road was blocked!

285
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,320
Lassie, don't go this way...

286
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:11,959
In here?

287
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:21,690
Oh? What is that? This place?

288
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,678
Amazing...!

289
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,264
Mountain grapes!

290
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,999
<i>This is the best mountain grapes
we can make wine from!</i>

291
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,624
Abandon the cows and milk, look at this!

292
00:17:41,913 --> 00:17:42,850
Lassie!

293
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:44,413
<i>Damn!</i>

294
00:17:52,827 --> 00:17:54,600
Follow us, follow us!

295
00:17:54,718 --> 00:17:56,913
It was better to do this from the start!

296
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:04,077
Stop it, Moo!

297
00:18:04,102 --> 00:18:05,593
We have to hurry up!

298
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:06,593
Ah!

299
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:10,656
Oh!

300
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,510
Moo!

301
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,968
Uncle, wait!

302
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,147
Wait!

303
00:18:19,507 --> 00:18:20,335
Ah ah...!

304
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,327
Ah!

305
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:30,202
Do you understand what you've done wrong?

306
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,843
Moo... Moo... I wanted to save them...

307
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:37,100
I don't want you to sell it!

308
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,179
Sandy!

309
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:43,264
Do you think I would prefer to sell it?

310
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,757
Because of your help for Moo

311
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:48,194
I faced more difficulty!

312
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,194
You have to understand that!

313
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,554
I don't understand!

314
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,165
If you don't want to sell it, don't do it!

315
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,725
Father...

316
00:18:57,742 --> 00:18:59,109
Father...

317
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:01,694
I hate you!

318
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:08,419
Sandy!

319
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,350
Uncle, can't you help Moo in any way?

320
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:20,788
You say I help her? If I could,
I have done that before!

321
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,241
You too! You did reckless things!

322
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:31,147
Moo's baby is about to die.

323
00:19:31,444 --> 00:19:32,663
If left next to Moo,

324
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,124
it can never drink cow's milk.

325
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,421
But, maybe there is some way...

326
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,147
Well that's a lot... too much...

327
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,772
Hello, Lassie!

328
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,194
Has not changed yet...

329
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,179
Her milk has not yet come out.

330
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,975
I see.

331
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,694
You are also worried about it.

332
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,311
Well, you can't stay that way.

333
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,069
Sandy...

334
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:33,460
Sandy...

335
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:38,772
Lassie?

336
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:40,663
- Oh?
- Um?

337
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:42,132
Oh?

338
00:20:42,561 --> 00:20:43,483
Hey!

339
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,811
No way!

340
00:20:44,936 --> 00:20:47,170
Moo! The milk came out!

341
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,387
What is the matter? Why did everyone rush so?

342
00:20:54,164 --> 00:20:55,598
I don't believe that!

343
00:20:56,511 --> 00:20:57,386
<i>Oh?!</i>

344
00:21:06,922 --> 00:21:07,766
You did it!

345
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:10,774
I was looking hard for these flowers!

346
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,060
When Sandy's father was born

347
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:16,162
we made her eat them until
her condition improved one day.

348
00:21:16,456 --> 00:21:17,862
Is this a popular remedy?

349
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:18,909
Right!

350
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:19,792
Moo...

351
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,893
You, you know that?

352
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,479
Isn't it wonderful, Sandy?

353
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:30,838
No, Dad!

354
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,706
I can't do anything except milking!

355
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,768
You leave this job to me!

356
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,753
Silly...

357
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,534
Father...

358
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,721
I'm sorry...

359
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,526
<i>My father saved a very huge man on his way.</i>

360
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:04,768
<i>That huge guy was working hard.</i>

361
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:07,752
<i>But the police came to the area strangely.</i>

362
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:10,799
<i>There is a thief who stole from the bank.</i>

363
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,385
<i>Next episode:
FOLLOW THE SUSPICIOUS MAN</i>

364
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:16,010
<i>Be sure to watch!</i>
