1
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:26,605
John, I count on you for the rest!

2
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:28,754
Yes, I accompanied you to safety!

3
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,750
HURRY! SAVE DR. HOOPER

4
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:52,913
Yes!

5
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,199
Good morning, John!

6
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:58,237
Ah! Have you finished?

7
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:01,119
Good morning, Lassie!

8
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:01,881
Come on!

9
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,380
Show her!

10
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,786
Well!

11
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,180
Before everything,

12
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,420
I will give it to the aunt because
she taught me how to make it!

13
00:02:09,617 --> 00:02:11,053
Nothing to me?

14
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,803
John's share is here, no need to worry!

15
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,663
Where's the aunt?

16
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:18,749
She went to work already!

17
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:20,007
Eh?

18
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,330
Don't worry!

19
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:23,030
We'll ask Lassie to deliver it!

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,905
I rely on you, Lassie!

21
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:34,350
Sandy, we'll be late!

22
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,296
Wait! Wait! Wait!

23
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,850
I apologize for making you wait!

24
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,172
Doctor, don't do it!

25
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:26,436
Be patient!

26
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:28,991
What is the matter?

27
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,960
I told you!

28
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,429
I have dealt with your wound now.

29
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,253
It would be bad if I didn't treat it.

30
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:40,050
If you don't come, your bones may break!

31
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:42,272
Eh... Please stop it!

32
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,034
Take care of yourself!

33
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:45,589
The next patient!

34
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:48,027
Doctor, my daughter is in bad shape today!

35
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:49,480
Doctor, please save her!

36
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:50,543
xxx

37
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,730
Calm down, what happened?

38
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,150
Her temperature suddenly rose!

39
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:57,269
Doctor!

40
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,002
<i>Put her here!</i>

41
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,950
Doctor, what's up?

42
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:09,360
It's not bad.

43
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:11,111
But it hurts a lot!

44
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,400
<i>Because parents are upset
when the child is sick!</i>

45
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:19,651
Give her good food, and
let her sleep comfortably.

46
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:20,708
But...

47
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,890
<i>I think your baby feels cold because
she's covered with many blankets, right?</i>

48
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:27,606
Yes.

49
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,312
<i>I understand this feeling.</i>

50
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,944
<i>You have to let her play a lot.</i>

51
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,429
<i>Is that just it?</i>

52
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,545
It's important to monitor
the temperature of young children.

53
00:04:40,077 --> 00:04:40,686
<i>Well...</i>

54
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:44,193
<i>Because of what happened
to her she feels cold.</i>

55
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,264
<i>Yes!</i>

56
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,670
Be careful!

57
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,178
Doctor, I still don't want her to move much!

58
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,592
Foolish!

59
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,146
What's in your mind?

60
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:59,070
You have to leave this child free!

61
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:04,325
Hm!

62
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,568
This dog steals my popularity.

63
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,608
Hm!

64
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,490
- That's it, Doctor!
- Yes!

65
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,570
What is the matter? What is the matter?

66
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,450
Damn...

67
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,870
Is my face so scary?

68
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,790
I love kids, but...

69
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,670
I can't face children!

70
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,380
Doctor, there are still others!

71
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,142
Well well!

72
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,010
Take care of yourself!

73
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,596
What do you think that
you accompany me today?

74
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,885
Don't worry!

75
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:10,314
She only watches you.

76
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,439
So don't run away, sir!

77
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,802
<i>What do you think?</i>

78
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:24,942
Is it delicious?

79
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,833
Yes.

80
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,925
I wonder if the aunt can taste it?

81
00:06:29,044 --> 00:06:31,888
Don't worry, Lassie will give it to her!

82
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:35,489
I don't mean that, but I mean
if it's delicious or not!

83
00:06:35,638 --> 00:06:36,942
Tasty! Tasty!

84
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:38,794
Yes, no doubt about it!

85
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,482
Yes!

86
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,050
It's delicious!

87
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,606
Did you teach her?

88
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,480
That girl is very skilled.

89
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:56,434
I think Sandy has a good sense of taste!

90
00:06:56,489 --> 00:06:57,075
Hm!

91
00:06:57,294 --> 00:07:00,942
And what about your son John, he has what?

92
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:01,935
Eh?

93
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:03,403
You mean John?

94
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:04,831
I don't know.

95
00:07:04,856 --> 00:07:07,106
It's still unclear.

96
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,360
But he is the owner of Lassie even grown up, right?

97
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:13,200
He only runs and plays with it!

98
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:14,794
But definitely....

99
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:19,324
Although he is very angry with it,
he still takes good care of it!

100
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,449
By the way, Doctor, why don't you
go somewhere today?

101
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,215
Hm?

102
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,933
You have treated many patients today.

103
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,886
Isn't that so?

104
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,792
This is true.

105
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,175
Well, that may be true.

106
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:35,394
I'll go for some time.

107
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:40,058
As I have always told you, when anything
happens I can hear the siren of the mine.

108
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:42,488
If something happens, send me a signal.

109
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,550
What is it today?

110
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:49,159
You usually say, "I decided to go today,
I've been patient enough"!

111
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,320
Why didn't you say that as usual?

112
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:55,847
If the patient is late, I will have
to work until evening.

113
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,324
You also need to pick up your energy again!

114
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,615
Well, he began to cast some good words!

115
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:13,287
Well...

116
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:15,271
Will you go too?

117
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:30,990
Hm?

118
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,083
What is the matter?

119
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:37,708
It's true that I asked you to help me, but
I didn't mean to join me at the fishing too!

120
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,810
Well it does not matter!

121
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,818
<i>What do you think?</i>

122
00:08:57,935 --> 00:09:01,130
<i>I'm the only one who knows about this spot!</i>

123
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,083
Lassie!

124
00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:20,083
What do you think of
the village of Greenor Bridge?

125
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,177
I love this village.

126
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:27,540
I traveled in many cities and villages

127
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,170
but this is a good village.

128
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,380
Security, peace...

129
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,279
Also all villagers work hard.

130
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:45,247
Do you think these words come out
of an old man only?

131
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,013
Don't be silly!

132
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,122
My clinic is a medical clinic.

133
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,404
Big things are not strange to me.

134
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,490
So I have to keep some strength.

135
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,169
<i>Do you understand?</i>

136
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,888
No, it's not true!

137
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:11,372
I have to prepare for those big things!

138
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:18,076
I feel like an old man walking around here and
there without paying attention to anything!

139
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,940
Nurse Carraclough works alone.

140
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,677
<i>If something serious happens there,
it will be a big problem!</i>

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,349
If you think about it, I can't sleep at night.

142
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:32,615
I didn't even take a nap.

143
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:36,872
No, that's not true.

144
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,427
Although I love my work...

145
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:50,944
Hm?

146
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,568
What's up, Lassie?

147
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:53,530
Oh!

148
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,890
I've got it!

149
00:10:58,428 --> 00:11:00,037
Well well!

150
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:02,983
Got it!

151
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,545
Ah!

152
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,240
What do you think, Lassie?

153
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,373
Isn't it good?

154
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,084
I did it badly...

155
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,300
But Lassie, did you enjoy the day?

156
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,471
Right! Right!

157
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:40,495
Hm? What is the matter?

158
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,737
My foot is under the rock...

159
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,951
I appreciate your concern,
but this is impossible for you.

160
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,080
Well, I'll relax.

161
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:08,352
Lassie?

162
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,274
What happened to it?

163
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,134
The most recent thing it did?

164
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,009
Maybe it is taking a nap at home today!

165
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,050
It's you, Lassie?

166
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:30,220
What is the matter?

167
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:36,743
I see that you are in good health, Lassie.

168
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:39,478
What are you doing, Lassie?

169
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:43,752
Hm?

170
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,556
Lassie?

171
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,056
Lassie!

172
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:11,267
Where did it go?

173
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,205
With Sandy's sheep!

174
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:20,643
But they're at the farm.

175
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:23,223
<i>They didn't came on the pasture today.</i>

176
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:27,475
Hm...

177
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,349
Could it still be with my mom?

178
00:14:39,772 --> 00:14:40,616
Eh?

179
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,045
It's gone for a long time!

180
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:44,982
Didn't it came to pick you up?

181
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,084
But it didn't!

182
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:50,084
Where did it go?

183
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,703
Hello Smarty!

184
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:10,710
Smarty, did you see Lassie today?

185
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,070
Lassie!

186
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,703
W-what's up, Lassie?

187
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:35,070
Just a moment, what are you doing? Wait!

188
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:39,312
What's up with you?

189
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,398
Today you didn't came to school!

190
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:44,711
Where have you been?

191
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,336
Where were you playing?

192
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,992
Lassie? What is the matter?

193
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,015
Ah wait!

194
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,020
Wait, Lassie!

195
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:11,176
Ah! Hey!

196
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,360
Ah...!

197
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:33,450
<i>Doctor Hooper!</i>

198
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,193
Oh...

199
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,615
John!

200
00:16:37,825 --> 00:16:39,013
Doctor!

201
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,833
Doctor Hooper!

202
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,450
I wasn't attentive.

203
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:46,622
That's why I fell and the rocks fell
on my feet, and I can't move.

204
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,333
No use, it doesn't move!

205
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,085
Lassie!

206
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:06,021
Bring anyone...!

207
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,724
I know!

208
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,638
Lassie, I count on you in this!

209
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,083
<i>Get anyone!</i>

210
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:24,255
<i>The first person you meet, brought it here!</i>

211
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:25,332
<i>Did you understand?</i>

212
00:17:25,357 --> 00:17:27,271
<i>The first person you meet!</i>

213
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:41,387
Doctor, are you okay?

214
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,317
Lassie will attend someone immediately!

215
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,473
I'm sorry, John...

216
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:02,028
Oh?

217
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,075
<i>It's Lassie!</i>

218
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,426
What is the matter? Hm?

219
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,153
Well okay, why did you come today?

220
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:14,271
Oh?

221
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:18,475
Oh?

222
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:22,193
My God, what happened?

223
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,200
What's up, Lassie?

224
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,623
It's a handkerchief.

225
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,592
It's John's handkerchief!

226
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,896
SOS! It's bad!

227
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,451
Oh?

228
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:47,998
Oh?

229
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,654
What is the matter?

230
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:54,902
John wrote this, he's near the bridge!

231
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,442
Don't you know where he is?

232
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:57,522
Does anyone know you?

233
00:18:57,842 --> 00:18:59,670
xxx

234
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:01,803
- Oh?
- Oh?

235
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:14,638
Lassie, are you still looking?

236
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:19,545
How long will we stay like this?

237
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:20,621
Oh!

238
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:21,826
I'm sorry, John!

239
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,607
I've brought you in a difficult situation!

240
00:19:25,802 --> 00:19:27,592
Doctor! Are you okay?

241
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,842
Yes!

242
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,779
But if Lassie woudn't have told
about my problem...

243
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,969
No one wouldn't have found me!

244
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:40,992
I would have to wait until someone passed by.

245
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:42,289
Oh...!

246
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,814
Thinking about being more patient...!

247
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,337
I look like a great man!

248
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:51,095
Hm?

249
00:19:51,618 --> 00:19:54,845
John, have you heard that voice just now?

250
00:19:56,533 --> 00:19:57,431
Ah...!

251
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:02,681
Lassie!

252
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,267
What's up, Lassie?

253
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:06,353
Is it here?

254
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:07,530
Oh, he's there!

255
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:09,157
John! Dr. Hooper!

256
00:20:09,821 --> 00:20:11,884
Doctor, the help came!

257
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,915
Lassie called my father here!

258
00:20:15,189 --> 00:20:16,158
Y-yes...

259
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,376
Wait, John!

260
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:23,220
I'm coming to help you now!

261
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,626
I will certainly help you!

262
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:26,515
Lassie!

263
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:28,431
You've done your best, John!

264
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,212
Are you okay?

265
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,640
Stop it, Lassie, this tickles!

266
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,618
Lassie, stop it!

267
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:39,830
John...

268
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:41,673
Are you okay?

269
00:20:42,064 --> 00:20:43,924
xxx

270
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:46,103
Thank you!

271
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,755
Well, take care of yourself!

272
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,919
Doctor, the patients for today have finished!

273
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,403
I have survived by your favor!

274
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,107
Thank you again!

275
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,853
I'm still a doctor. I'm still slow to think.

276
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,556
Your presence was very helpful.

277
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:23,126
I'm glad it ended with this simple wound!

278
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:27,548
<i>But when you are in trouble you
need a real friend to support you!</i>

279
00:21:27,697 --> 00:21:30,783
<i>Lassie, you are a true friend!</i>

280
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,480
<i>Lassie!</i>

281
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:37,205
Next time I'll bring you a big fish!

282
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,400
<i>Doctor!</i>

283
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,020
Before that, you have to take care
of your wound until it heals!

284
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,267
I know that.

285
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,931
<i>You see? Lassie too says so!</i>

286
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:03,430
<i>The teacher Curry and Miss Mary,
the bakery owner, will marry!</i>

287
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:05,658
<i>But on the wedding day,</i>

288
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:08,863
<i>Miss Mary doesn't want to go to church!</i>

289
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:10,480
<i>What happened?</i>

290
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,410
<i>Next episode:
THE MARRIAGE OF TEACHER CURRY</i>

291
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,220
<i>Be sure to watch!</i>
