1
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,380
FOLLOW THE SUSPICIOUS MAN

2
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:02,201
Hm?

3
00:02:14,107 --> 00:02:16,115
Hey... just a moment!

4
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,147
Ah! Oh...!

5
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,224
How is he doing?

6
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:25,552
He is fine.

7
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,310
After he eats enough food
he will get better soon.

8
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:34,500
<i>I don't know his identity, but I apologize
because I looked at his luggage.</i>

9
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:36,770
<i>Do you know where he came from?</i>

10
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:37,527
No...

11
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,350
It's huge...!

12
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:56,115
One, two...

13
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:56,897
Oh...!

14
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:01,420
Ah...!

15
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,006
Whoa!

16
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:05,756
Oh...!

17
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:08,834
He waked up! Mom!

18
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,231
I see...!

19
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,825
<i>You're looking for work.</i>

20
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:31,646
You travel a lot, but as long
as you're physically fit

21
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,325
you can do a lot of work,

22
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:36,372
<i>don't you?</i>

23
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:39,327
This is very bad...

24
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:40,874
<i>Hm?</i>

25
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:42,741
<i>What's wrong?</i>

26
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:45,671
Sometimes I feel bad.

27
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:47,710
Is that so?

28
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,569
And now well...

29
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,142
Tell me, what will he do now?

30
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:11,299
He will stay in our house for
a while until he gets better.

31
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:14,691
Then where will he go?

32
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,449
After that, that's right!

33
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:22,238
He will find a place to stay if he works here.

34
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:26,034
What? You don't have to be so depressed!

35
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,995
My colleagues at work are good people!

36
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:29,839
<i>Don't worry, Ian!</i>

37
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,276
Ian?

38
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,502
Ian Cooper!

39
00:04:33,698 --> 00:04:35,135
This is his name!

40
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,170
Is that it?

41
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,580
You chose the man you
found falling in your way?

42
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:48,874
In the future, we will rely on this work!

43
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,475
Doesn't he look great in his work?

44
00:04:51,587 --> 00:04:54,076
We can't say it's just great.

45
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,290
<i>Even if the four vehicles are empty,
they are still made of iron!</i>

46
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:05,929
Oh really!

47
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:08,179
He has an amazing power!

48
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,742
His arms look like they were made of iron!

49
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,312
<i>Hey, Ian!</i>

50
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,921
If you have finished pushing the carts,
bring the shovels here!

51
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:23,038
Shovels?

52
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:26,340
Look, it's in that box near the warehouse!

53
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,692
I brought the shovels.

54
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:48,981
Oh!

55
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:51,028
You also brought the box?

56
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,942
Yes.

57
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:10,654
<i>I was very surprised!</i>

58
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:14,537
No one can carry all the shovels
inside the box, right?

59
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:22,160
But, he carried the box with all
the shovels! What a rare person!

60
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:23,535
Is it really amazing?

61
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:24,512
Yes!

62
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:31,051
Hm... um?

63
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:34,683
<i>That man is much bigger than you!</i>

64
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,780
It's up to this size!

65
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:39,956
We are detectives.

66
00:06:40,144 --> 00:06:42,441
<i>Ian Cooper...</i>

67
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:46,410
Mr. Carraclough seems
to have brought a good person.

68
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,550
Even though we hear some
strange words about him.

69
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,080
If we rely on him,
our work will be much easier!

70
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,605
That man was seen

71
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:11,503
by an employee at the mining office
last week as he was on his way...

72
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,331
It seems to be him.

73
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,535
Seemingly?

74
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:17,527
I feel it's definitely him!

75
00:07:17,706 --> 00:07:20,150
When we find a phone we will
contact the head office immediately!

76
00:07:20,426 --> 00:07:21,082
Yes!

77
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:24,104
Hey! Uncle!

78
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:24,816
Hm?

79
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,180
Is this car you, Uncle?

80
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:27,973
Yes.

81
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,019
There is nothing inside, really nothing.

82
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,205
Uncle, are you a merchant?

83
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:33,410
Merchant?

84
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:34,996
What? Am I wrong?

85
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,870
There are none other than the wandering
hyenas who come to this village in this way.

86
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:41,160
I asked if you were among them!

87
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,170
- We...
<i>- Walter!</i>

88
00:07:44,342 --> 00:07:45,084
Oh?

89
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,410
There is no time to talk with children!

90
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:48,880
I apologize very much!

91
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:50,701
A detective?

92
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:52,998
He's a policeman!

93
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,445
Something might have happened.

94
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:57,217
<i>News this evening:</i>

95
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:02,833
<i>Last Thursday, a criminal has robbed
London Bank and it's still at large.</i>

96
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,818
<i>The scope has been expanded
in England to look for</i>

97
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:09,662
<i>to solve this serious issue...</i>

98
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,090
<i>- "That's it!"</i>
- Says about a bank.

99
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,636
Well yes... Is that all?

100
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,183
Yes. Thanks, this will help us!

101
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:21,030
Detective!

102
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:24,275
That man that we talked about
before was here at the time.

103
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,636
That's what I thought!

104
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:30,310
I have worked at the police headquarters for 15
years, it's impossible for me to make a mistake!

105
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:35,659
I felt where he was now...

106
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:38,573
Why not take an insight into it?

107
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,182
The police of England

108
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:44,049
must arrest the bank robber!

109
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,049
Yes!

110
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,776
Bank robber?

111
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,737
The bank robber is in this village?

112
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,799
What is wrong with you?

113
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:14,987
Hm?

114
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,341
What is the matter?

115
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:18,245
Nothing!

116
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:25,765
Ah!

117
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,151
It's the right building!

118
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:28,182
Thanks!

119
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,210
Why are they heading towards the mine?

120
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:37,763
Wait, Lassie! Don't do it!

121
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:45,058
Hm?

122
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,107
Is it here?

123
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,560
Therefore, the store owner said completely.

124
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,710
But there is no light!

125
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,895
<i>Is he outside?</i>

126
00:09:53,044 --> 00:09:54,589
<i>Just watch!</i>

127
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:55,333
<i>Okay!</i>

128
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:57,485
What? It's the warehouse!

129
00:09:57,575 --> 00:09:59,098
What do they want from such a place?

130
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,949
<i>Light was turned on!</i>

131
00:10:01,387 --> 00:10:02,614
<i>I knew it!</i>

132
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,035
<i>Learn wisdom from me before uttering any word!</i>

133
00:10:06,145 --> 00:10:06,824
Yes!

134
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,660
Oh my God, my God, almost extinguished!

135
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,051
You have got a suitable place.

136
00:10:12,414 --> 00:10:13,332
How do you like it?

137
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,481
Is it okay to live here?

138
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,832
I apologize because I have no other room,
you can use it as you like!

139
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:21,512
Yes.

140
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:23,989
As for the food order,

141
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:29,114
you can go to Richard's shop,
which I told you about,

142
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:31,270
and I can bring it to you if you tell me.

143
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:32,231
Yes.

144
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,739
If the purposes are insufficient
or difficult, feel free to tell me!

145
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,387
You can rely on me!

146
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:38,388
Yes.

147
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,114
He looks like the real criminal!

148
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:41,637
Hm!

149
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,700
<i>See you again tomorrow!</i>

150
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,294
<i>I can't make mistakes!</i>

151
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,916
<i>He's the real criminal! No doubt about it!</i>

152
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:50,089
Oh ah!

153
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:51,581
Ah...

154
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:01,737
Father!

155
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:02,722
Yes?

156
00:11:03,131 --> 00:11:05,031
About the Ian's command...

157
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,645
Yes!

158
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,901
He's so good at the work in the mine!

159
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:08,722
Yes...

160
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,518
What is the truth about him?

161
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,877
What's up, John?

162
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:14,541
Your face seems strange!

163
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,518
Is there something that worries you?

164
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,744
This...

165
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,463
You too heard the rumors?

166
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,948
In fact I think all this is nonsense.

167
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:28,908
Of course I too heard those rumors about Ian.

168
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,432
But when I heard that

169
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:35,940
I thought it was important
to take more care of him.

170
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:37,550
Yes.

171
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,213
<i>That's a bit strange...
but that guy is really good!</i>

172
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,604
When I met Ian,

173
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,089
I thought that that person was terrifying.

174
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:51,713
You heard bad words about him, didn't you?

175
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,010
People become more terrified

176
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:56,972
when they talk bad of the others,
so they seem to have a lot of enemies.

177
00:11:57,502 --> 00:11:59,463
<i>It's painful to misunderstand him.</i>

178
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:03,362
Isn't that true?

179
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,377
Maybe the police officers misunderstood
him because they didn't know him well!

180
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,018
But if he was the bank, he really would...

181
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,409
I don't know!

182
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:20,315
Certainly the police will find the truth!

183
00:12:20,455 --> 00:12:22,651
That's why I will not interfere!

184
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,341
But...

185
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,309
What if Ian is really a criminal...

186
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:33,364
My father will be sad...

187
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,578
He hasn't moved yet...

188
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:43,641
That's what I thought!

189
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:47,016
He thinks this place is his best hiding place.

190
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,109
In such a simple place,
no evidence will be left behind!

191
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,270
What would you do if you don't
find any evidence against him?

192
00:12:53,391 --> 00:12:54,922
I will depend on you!

193
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:55,657
Oh?

194
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,078
Tomorrow I will leave it to you.

195
00:12:58,212 --> 00:12:58,829
Oh!

196
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,410
What about you, detective?

197
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,227
Hm!

198
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,585
Well, just watch me!

199
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,188
I will set a trap in this city for that man!

200
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,660
<i>Good morning, Sam!</i>

201
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,694
<i>Good Morning, Ed!</i>

202
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:27,249
<i>Good morning, Sam!</i>

203
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:28,475
Good morning, Kevin!

204
00:13:30,171 --> 00:13:31,968
Ah! Good morning, Ian!

205
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,764
He's a really big man!

206
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,085
<i>Ian Cooper.</i>

207
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,702
Did he do something bad?

208
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,616
No, just that London police are looking for

209
00:13:57,734 --> 00:14:00,382
someone who looks like him!

210
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,803
Can he be a bank robber as the rumors say?

211
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,749
Oh!

212
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,365
It seems that this man
has found a good job here.

213
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,220
Yes.

214
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:13,778
Whoever goes, he will never
be released from prison!

215
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:14,921
Prison?

216
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:16,866
No, I didn't mean anything!

217
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:17,913
Sorry!

218
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,367
Is there a mine?

219
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,610
Does your husband work in the mine too?

220
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:34,383
Yes!

221
00:14:34,594 --> 00:14:36,336
I worry about him!

222
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:40,391
<i>John!</i>

223
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,680
<i>John! John!</i>

224
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:43,782
Eh... eh?

225
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:47,617
We've agreed to pick up
some berries today, right?

226
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:48,258
Uh-uh...

227
00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:49,125
Sorry.

228
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:51,015
I'm a bit busy!

229
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:51,766
Uh?

230
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,380
John left...

231
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:57,243
Hm...

232
00:15:17,672 --> 00:15:19,220
Where are you going?

233
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:21,664
Oh?

234
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,500
Where he goes?

235
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:34,133
Lassie...

236
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:52,282
Oh!

237
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,039
He disappeared...

238
00:15:57,118 --> 00:15:57,797
Oh!

239
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:00,859
What? It's you, Lassie?

240
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,234
Hey, where is he going?

241
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:06,922
Oh!

242
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,328
Ian?

243
00:16:15,117 --> 00:16:16,594
Ah! A knife?

244
00:16:17,086 --> 00:16:18,008
Ah-ah ah!

245
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,100
Did the police come to your house as well?

246
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:24,937
Yes!

247
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,562
This is what they told to my family!

248
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:29,750
Did he really participate in the bank robbery?

249
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:33,469
Maybe we'll be deceived by
the bank robbery, I'm worried!

250
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,368
Hey!

251
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:35,110
Oh!

252
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,789
He has a criminal record!

253
00:16:49,868 --> 00:16:50,414
Oh?

254
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:53,906
<i>He had to bring that man here!</i>

255
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,055
<i>You may be right!</i>

256
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:58,529
He is a criminal.

257
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:01,840
What does Mr. Carraclough think?

258
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,370
Hey!

259
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,232
Is there a problem with my father?

260
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:08,771
No, nothing at all!

261
00:17:11,176 --> 00:17:12,399
Welcome back, John!

262
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,184
What is the matter?

263
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:15,777
Dad, I want to talk to you a bit!

264
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:17,449
About Ian...

265
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:20,543
Ian has come here.

266
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:24,121
I invited him to dinner because
he worked hard today!

267
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,020
It is very delicious!

268
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:34,910
Of course, because it's taboo!

269
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:36,863
<i>Ian, do you want another bowl?</i>

270
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:38,395
<i>Yes!</i>

271
00:17:38,632 --> 00:17:39,802
<i>What's up, John?</i>

272
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:41,199
<i>You are quiet.</i>

273
00:17:41,278 --> 00:17:41,879
<i>Yes.</i>

274
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:44,420
Yes!

275
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,098
Hello, is that you?

276
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:47,207
Mr. Carraclough!

277
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:47,980
What is the matter?

278
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:51,787
Sir Carraclough, when I left,
something bad happened!

279
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:54,778
The manager has lost his golden watch!

280
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:57,857
Mr. Carraclough, that man you brought

281
00:17:58,155 --> 00:18:01,116
is the real thief!

282
00:18:01,185 --> 00:18:02,170
That man?

283
00:18:02,303 --> 00:18:03,370
It's Ian!

284
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,600
We have been deceived!

285
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:08,701
You, what are you doing here?

286
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:12,232
Ian is here.

287
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,037
Eh?

288
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,873
<i>Anyway, get out of here.</i>

289
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,193
What did Ian do?

290
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,287
Did you hear that from the police?

291
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:28,933
Grandma Forrest heard about
of the strange rumor they had published.

292
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:31,636
They are here now.

293
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,136
You!

294
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:39,634
Oh?

295
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:42,330
Why do you accuse Ian of criminality?

296
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,253
Do you have any evidence?

297
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:48,970
That's right, leave the rest to us!

298
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,339
<i>Do you have any evidence?</i>

299
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,355
We can have you arrested.

300
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:56,440
Why did you accused Ian being
a criminal by spreading rumors?

301
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,464
What would you do if he is innocent?

302
00:18:58,628 --> 00:19:00,930
<i>I won't stop from discovering the truth!</i>

303
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,112
But stop spreading doubts
among the villagers!

304
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:05,167
That's it!

305
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:06,761
Hm!

306
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,956
You can come back now!

307
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,331
- Father!
- Yes.

308
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:13,253
I have seen him...

309
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:15,253
Ian had a knife.

310
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:18,105
I know, it was part of the luggage.

311
00:19:18,136 --> 00:19:18,800
Eh?

312
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,880
John, you also have a knife, right?

313
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,463
And I'm the one who gave it to you.

314
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:26,042
Yes.

315
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:27,683
That's right!

316
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:33,565
<i>Those people have just
listened to our conversation.</i>

317
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:35,448
Yes, but...

318
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,005
Quick, after them!

319
00:19:37,112 --> 00:19:38,440
Yes yes!

320
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,635
It will be good to be the thief.

321
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:42,994
I'll catch him...!

322
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,730
<i>I'm going!</i>

323
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,611
Listen, Lassie!

324
00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:51,650
I don't know the truth yet.

325
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,170
I have to trust Ian!

326
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:56,830
This is because he works hard with my father!

327
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,500
What's up, Lassie?

328
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,020
I'll be late for school!

329
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:03,994
Lassie, wait!

330
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:06,900
Please enter!

331
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,870
Why the police come early in the morning?

332
00:20:11,947 --> 00:20:14,360
Hasn't your boss come yet?

333
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,229
Not yet.

334
00:20:15,307 --> 00:20:18,525
Can we wait here for him to come?

335
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,721
Please enter.

336
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,189
You can wait in the manager's office, there.

337
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:24,393
Eh...

338
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,268
By the way, what questions should we ask him?

339
00:20:28,784 --> 00:20:29,417
Hm!

340
00:20:29,827 --> 00:20:30,854
You are the detective!

341
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,322
This is bad!

342
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:36,055
To do something like that!

343
00:20:36,143 --> 00:20:37,197
Just close your mouth!

344
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:38,799
Perhaps the man in the next room notices us!

345
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,409
Hey Lassie!

346
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,018
Oh...

347
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,244
Maybe this is it!

348
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:08,450
What do you mean?

349
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,049
I was right!

350
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,549
It's not good to forget such
an important thing here,

351
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:15,690
what a terrible man!

352
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,940
I'll tell them we have found the watch.

353
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:46,729
No, don't tell to the people!

354
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:47,698
Oh?

355
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,770
<i>However I will inevitably catch him!</i>

356
00:21:58,693 --> 00:21:59,760
<i>It's bad!</i>

357
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,590
<i>Ian has been arrested!</i>

358
00:22:01,658 --> 00:22:04,955
<i>Ian was arrested for stealing the golden
watch as the interrogator accused him!</i>

359
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:07,150
<i>That guy is not bad!</i>

360
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:10,018
<i>Lassie, I'm sure there is something!</i>

361
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,291
<i>Next episode:
DETECTING THE INNOCENCE OF IAN</i>

362
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:14,840
<i>Be sure to watch!</i>
