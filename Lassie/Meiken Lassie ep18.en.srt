1
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,089
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

2
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:29,870
<i>Welcome to Benjamin Circus!</i>

3
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,130
<i>This is the first time that
many tricks we'll be played here!</i>

4
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,130
A BIG PROBLEM! THE ELEPHANT
ESCAPED FROM THE CIRCUS

5
00:01:34,238 --> 00:01:36,332
<i>Please enjoy with us!</i>

6
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:50,464
Oh...!

7
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:56,589
Oh...!

8
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,736
And now, gentlemen,

9
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,338
We have reached to our most important treasure!

10
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:25,947
It is a well-trained animal and it's
the most important star of our circus!

11
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,604
And now I present:

12
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:29,984
The elephant Rosalind!

13
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:38,160
Just awesome! It's a real elephant!

14
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:39,229
It's huge...!

15
00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:41,112
Oh...

16
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,026
<i>Please relax!</i>

17
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:54,127
Rosalind will surprise you when it
listens to everything I say to it!

18
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:56,143
Now let's start!

19
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,026
This rare elephant will move
the ball with its feet!

20
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:14,291
What are you doing? Move quickly!

21
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:25,533
And now, gentlemen, the elephant
will move the ball with its feet!

22
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:40,783
I'm sorry!

23
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:42,790
But this is just a greeting.

24
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:46,220
To describe the second event!

25
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,822
Well done!

26
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,150
Just awesome! Just awesome! Just awesome!

27
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,180
Have you enjoyed, John?

28
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,774
It was very fun!

29
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:27,680
Is that right? I'm glad to hear that!

30
00:04:31,343 --> 00:04:32,250
Lassie...

31
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:34,601
The circus was very fun!

32
00:04:34,702 --> 00:04:37,555
Unfortunately we didn't get a ticket for you!

33
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:40,625
The best of the acrobat games
is the elephant show!

34
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:41,950
<i>But...</i>

35
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,288
<i>He had to frighten it with the whip.</i>

36
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:46,867
Hm...!

37
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,280
That's true, maybe it didn't listen
to him because of what he did.

38
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,999
<i>You are right.</i>

39
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,314
Rosalind!

40
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:03,376
What's with your behaviour today?

41
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,571
You have caused me embarrassment!

42
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:08,579
<i>How long will these acts continue?</i>

43
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,954
<i>You are bad!</i>

44
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:11,546
<i>Bad!</i>

45
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:12,564
<i>You are bad!</i>

46
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,194
<i>You are useless!</i>

47
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:15,969
<i>You have to save your style in acrobatics!</i>

48
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,438
- He is still angry.
- Yes.

49
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,680
You huge nasty one!

50
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,360
Excuse me, Captain...

51
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:24,048
Uh? What is the matter?

52
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,274
I have to feed Rosalind.

53
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,508
Feed it?

54
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:30,800
You don't have to!

55
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,235
If it doesn't do acrobatics,
there is no food for it!

56
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,320
<i>Today it will remain hungry!</i>

57
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,550
If you want to eat, don't miss it again,
understand? Huh!

58
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,760
We can't do anything as long as long
he's angry. It's just an animal.

59
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,633
Rosalind... What a poor man...

60
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:07,061
Oh... What's up, Lassie?

61
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:07,985
Oh!

62
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,900
It's still six o'clock.

63
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:14,601
Today is also a holiday from school...

64
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,390
Hey Lassie!

65
00:09:20,515 --> 00:09:22,711
Where are you going with these?

66
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,093
Wonderful weather!

67
00:09:31,593 --> 00:09:35,547
It's good to walk early in the forest!

68
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,990
You brought me here to see this behind?

69
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,068
What is behind it?

70
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,178
A-ah...

71
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,870
Lassie!

72
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:04,412
Inside there is an elephant!

73
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:15,935
Ah!

74
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:18,333
It's not possible!

75
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,388
It seems surprised!

76
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:21,435
Oh?

77
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,450
<i>I understood, you brought this apple for it...</i>

78
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,115
Lassie...

79
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:51,701
This elephant ate the apple that I gave to it!

80
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:54,428
Good!

81
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,708
Now, you want to eat these?

82
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,357
I wonder if Rosalind has learned a lesson?

83
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:16,209
Oh!

84
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,085
You can't... Rosalind!

85
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,671
This is bad!

86
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,944
Look! Come out!

87
00:11:44,793 --> 00:11:46,976
Come on, there's no need to fear!

88
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:48,273
Come here!

89
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,304
You have beautiful eyes...!

90
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,113
Whoa! Great!

91
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:40,836
You have a great appetite!

92
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:49,223
But although the size of the elephant
is huge, it's full of scratches.

93
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:54,990
Ah! Sorry!

94
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,279
Have you suffered?

95
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,779
<i>Okay!</i>

96
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,381
Wait here!

97
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:08,881
I will bring first aid kit
from home to treat you!

98
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,709
I will also bring you more apples!

99
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,084
Come on, Lassie!

100
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:18,513
You have to wait a little!

101
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,951
I didn't see him!

102
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:31,099
Today I woke up late and
I didn't see anything.

103
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:33,040
Is that right? Thanks!

104
00:13:33,115 --> 00:13:33,803
<i>Let's go!</i>

105
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,263
Who are they?

106
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,620
They are the people who were in the circus!

107
00:13:40,756 --> 00:13:42,326
It's Mr. Pierrot, whom we saw yesterday.

108
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,147
Eh?

109
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,300
- No one saw it.
- Yes.

110
00:13:45,412 --> 00:13:46,271
We also asked them.

111
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:50,260
We had to pay more attention to the elephant.

112
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,479
When he failed to hit it with a whip
and prevent him from eating.

113
00:13:53,588 --> 00:13:56,190
It's a miracle he didn't lose his senses.

114
00:13:56,315 --> 00:14:00,505
At night I heard the sad voice of Rosalind...

115
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,896
I couldn't forget its voice.

116
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,544
This is so terrible...

117
00:14:36,873 --> 00:14:38,247
Hm? What is that?

118
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,040
The latest thing?

119
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:49,850
Dial the police number!

120
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,570
It's a bad thing, it's an elephant!
It walks around!

121
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:54,789
An elephant?

122
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:56,187
An elephant...

123
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,453
Who has a long nose?

124
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:00,321
<i>Hey!</i>

125
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:01,980
<i>Rosalind!</i>

126
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:03,110
<i>Hey...!</i>

127
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,664
<i>Rosalind?</i>

128
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,890
Where did you go?

129
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:09,844
Hey!

130
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:20,055
Lassie, did you smell Rosalind?

131
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,594
I see!

132
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,953
Maybe he caught up with us.

133
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,578
Now come on!

134
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,836
Hey Rosalind!

135
00:15:37,148 --> 00:15:38,859
Let's go back to the circus!

136
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,242
If you don't listen to me...!

137
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:43,727
Oh!

138
00:16:07,969 --> 00:16:09,070
The police car...

139
00:16:09,164 --> 00:16:10,320
What happens?

140
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,110
Could it be that elephant?

141
00:16:12,187 --> 00:16:15,450
We heard that this elephant was walking out!

142
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,578
P-please wait!

143
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,984
To bring such weapons...

144
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:22,187
It's not dangerous.

145
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,578
It's the precious treasure of our circus!

146
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,101
If you kill it, we will lose our lives!

147
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,430
If so, take it quickly from here!

148
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:38,930
If the elephant hails and hits people,
we will get rid of it immediately!

149
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:41,164
Ah, I know that!

150
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,320
Well, I will do everything!

151
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,242
You heard, Rosalind?

152
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,390
Listen to my orders only!

153
00:16:56,895 --> 00:16:59,547
Listen to my promises directly!

154
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,180
Otherwise...

155
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,914
Oh?

156
00:17:14,782 --> 00:17:15,625
Move!

157
00:17:19,828 --> 00:17:21,344
Ah-ah...!

158
00:17:22,055 --> 00:17:22,594
Oh!

159
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,007
- xxx
- Wait!

160
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,742
Wait a moment!

161
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:28,828
It will listen to me now!

162
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,594
Listen to me immediately, you bad!

163
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,554
There is no point in doing such acts...

164
00:17:36,774 --> 00:17:38,625
Oh! xxx

165
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:44,710
What are you doing, Rosalind?

166
00:17:44,907 --> 00:17:45,547
Oh?

167
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,110
What is this dog?

168
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,530
You hear? They'll shot him at once!

169
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,773
<i>Stop!</i>

170
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,828
Rosalind!

171
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,812
Don't do such a thing...

172
00:17:57,914 --> 00:17:58,969
You know me!

173
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,609
Kid, this is dangerous!

174
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:02,372
Don't shoot!

175
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:05,531
Rosalind is really good!

176
00:18:05,656 --> 00:18:07,730
Run away, John! This is dangerous!

177
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,720
Get back, you'll be hurt!

178
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:12,000
It's not harmful!

179
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,648
But it doesn't listen to my orders!

180
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,922
Rosalind...

181
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,922
Look at me, Rosalind!

182
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:34,883
I promised that I bring you apples!

183
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:36,547
Here!

184
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:44,860
Ah...

185
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:49,446
Ah!

186
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:50,492
John!

187
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:02,633
<i>Oh...</i>

188
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:09,844
<i>Oh...!</i>

189
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:12,133
Oh...!

190
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,600
It have eaten!

191
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:15,125
Oh...!

192
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,821
<i>Oh...!</i>

193
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,370
Rosalind?

194
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:22,858
This work again!

195
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:24,210
It's wrong, this...

196
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,510
Can be done by...

197
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,586
What about this barrel?

198
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:31,344
Yes!

199
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,328
Rosalind!

200
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,414
Rosalind, use this!

201
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:38,680
I see!

202
00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:42,711
Rosalind, wants to show us
an offer as an apology?

203
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:54,635
<i>John!</i>

204
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:57,860
Well done!

205
00:19:57,971 --> 00:19:59,783
You have prepared him to his senses!

206
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,502
Excuse me, boy...

207
00:20:04,932 --> 00:20:07,127
I have a request.

208
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:10,088
To teach me how you managed
to bring Rosalind back to normal?

209
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,070
I won't do it!

210
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,166
Why?

211
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:18,041
Because Rosalind is afraid of the whip, uncle.

212
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:19,485
Still not afraid of whip.

213
00:20:19,627 --> 00:20:21,892
You have to listen to others.

214
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,463
You don't understand the animal's mood, so
understand this before returning to the circus.

215
00:20:25,877 --> 00:20:27,853
So Rosalind will escape again!

216
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:29,353
Isn't it, Lassie?

217
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,377
This boy speaks to me insolently!

218
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:35,221
Captain, stop that!

219
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:37,090
His saying is absolutely true!

220
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:40,755
We also believe that what
you did to Rosalind is terrible.

221
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,560
Rosalind is very poor!

222
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:46,135
Captain, if you don't think
of fixing the deal with Rosalind,

223
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:48,745
it won't go back to the circus again!

224
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:50,330
Us too...

225
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,688
Okay, here you go!

226
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,290
Give it to Rosalind!

227
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,853
Boy, Rosalind is fine now.

228
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:05,673
We will take good care of it!

229
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:06,353
Yes!

230
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,550
<i>All of you, have you enjoyed with us?</i>

231
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,462
And now, Benjamin Circus is back again!

232
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,079
We will show you this time
a new and unique show!

233
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,157
This circus treasure...

234
00:21:30,347 --> 00:21:34,368
<i>The elephant Rosalind! Queen Sera!</i>

235
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:43,713
In return I managed
to get a special ticket.

236
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:45,432
That's great!

237
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,790
<i>That day we went on
a trip outside the village.</i>

238
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:03,792
<i>We all boarded a ship to see the sea!</i>

239
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,240
<i>And on that ship,</i>

240
00:22:05,362 --> 00:22:07,768
<i>a girl has become our friend.</i>

241
00:22:07,885 --> 00:22:10,932
<i>She owned a treasure map.</i>

242
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,276
<i>Next episode:
COLIN'S LOVE AND THE TREASURE</i>

243
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:15,885
<i>Be sure to watch!</i>
