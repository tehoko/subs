1
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,950
RUNNING TOWARDS THE DREAM

2
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,537
Father! Mom!

3
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:35,670
- Come on!
- Yes!

4
00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:45,374
- Ah!
- Oh!

5
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:46,857
Lassie!

6
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,576
Lassie!

7
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:49,655
Ah...!

8
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:51,631
Lassie...

9
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,240
Lassie was walking for a long time...

10
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,131
It's normal to fall after
walking all this distance!

11
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:02,600
It lost all its energy after it returned to us!

12
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,928
Mom, do you think Lassie...?

13
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,701
It will be fine.

14
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:09,045
Although it came from Scotland up to here!

15
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:10,709
It has no strength.

16
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:13,037
It has to recover slowly.

17
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,506
Lassie...

18
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,451
Lassie did all this for us...

19
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:20,428
Yes.

20
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,881
Grandfather...

21
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,810
In any case, we'll take
Lassie to John's house!

22
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:31,600
Yes!

23
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:33,655
Oh?

24
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:36,248
Ian!

25
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,311
Can you carry Lassie home, Ian?

26
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,365
And now, here is your home!

27
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,795
Lassie, sleep peacefully...

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,365
I won't send you anywhere!

29
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,795
For this you shall rest assured!

30
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,014
It's asleep!

31
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:20,875
Yes.

32
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,678
After it sleeps well, it will reactivate!

33
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,920
And so, we have to go back!

34
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:29,857
It returned after walking 600 miles!

35
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:31,660
It's an unreasonable distance for it!

36
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:33,131
That dog...

37
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,529
It returned and it completely
destroyed his hair and body!

38
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,772
Grandfather!

39
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,201
Grandfaher, are you still thinking
about taking Lassie?

40
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:41,256
No!

41
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:46,147
I mean that the dog's hair
was affected by rain and mud.

42
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:48,975
I was trying to say it is a great dog!

43
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:50,577
Yes!

44
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,498
- We go too!
- Take care of it!

45
00:03:53,523 --> 00:03:54,030
Yes!

46
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:55,123
Thank you!

47
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,459
It sleeps deeply.

48
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,092
That's great, John!

49
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,061
Yes.

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,022
His body is tired so it
may not walk for a while.

51
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,334
You should take good care of it.

52
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,444
Yes!

53
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:18,335
xxx

54
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,830
John, breakfast is ready!

55
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,655
<i>I change my clothes now!</i>

56
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,163
It is still sleeping on the kitchen floor!

57
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:51,530
<i>Good morning!</i>

58
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:53,295
<i>Have you slept well, Lassie?</i>

59
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:54,304
<i>Come on!</i>

60
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,045
Lassie, it's breakfast!

61
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,218
Its body is too tired,

62
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:03,045
so it can't eat by himself!

63
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,569
I'll feed you, Lassie!

64
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:15,380
Lassie...

65
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:16,487
Lassie!

66
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:17,113
Hey!

67
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:18,362
He will be fine.

68
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,691
It slept again!

69
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,862
It feels comfortable when it is on your feet.

70
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,667
Hello!

71
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:38,722
How is Lassie?

72
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:39,785
Yes...

73
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,745
It woke up, but it was hard for it!

74
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:43,831
It should get well slowly.

75
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:48,055
But his ear was completely destroyed!

76
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:49,605
You've got a travel badge!

77
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,972
Hm, but this is very good!

78
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:57,144
In this way the rich man Rudling will not
put eyes on him, and he will keep them shut!

79
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:57,886
Yes!

80
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:00,198
I don't care about the shape at all!

81
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,120
What is important is to be with me!

82
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:05,280
Well, do your best!

83
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:07,089
Try a little more, Lassie!

84
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:08,496
Ah...

85
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:13,011
Lassie... you're gonna be fine!

86
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,175
Soon you can travel anywhere you want!

87
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:19,167
Bye! Good night!

88
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,034
Yes! Good night!

89
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:37,096
Hm?

90
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,030
Lassie!

91
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,682
You walk!

92
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,252
I see!

93
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,635
It started eating as usual!

94
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:58,018
Your Majesty!

95
00:06:58,104 --> 00:06:59,619
Your Majesty the Duke of Rudling!

96
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:00,362
Hm?

97
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,720
Aren't you Majesty Duke Rudling?

98
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:06,776
Your Majesty, you seem to have revived the mine

99
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:09,605
as a miracle, and was about to close!

100
00:07:09,736 --> 00:07:11,190
Unfortunately...

101
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,550
...this was not my achievement!

102
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:14,534
Oh?

103
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:15,750
If so...?

104
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:16,955
Who was it?

105
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:21,197
It's because of a boy and his dog!

106
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,649
No, it's not.

107
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:25,799
That dog is a Collie.

108
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:27,268
Hm...

109
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,916
It seems to have happened very well!

110
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:31,820
What about that?

111
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,721
Can't you tell me?

112
00:07:33,863 --> 00:07:36,643
No. Are you a journalist?

113
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,950
Yeah, I'm from the London Journal...

114
00:07:40,424 --> 00:07:45,096
If it is possible to tell us about
the cause of this miracle

115
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,330
until we publish his command in this world!

116
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:49,268
Hm!

117
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,135
No, it should not.

118
00:07:52,424 --> 00:07:58,370
It deserves praise from all people directly.

119
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,659
I believe that the music
you play draws a xxx

120
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:09,455
up to the fullest of the sky
like the winds of the wind.

121
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:13,565
<i>So put your hand on your chest and be brave!</i>

122
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:17,080
<i>Ah, my heart, I'm happy to be lonely!</i>

123
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,619
This is all for this lesson!

124
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,822
It's important not to forget your homework!

125
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:30,471
Oh...

126
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:32,424
Ah!

127
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:33,159
Eh?

128
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:35,315
Ah...

129
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,160
Lassie!

130
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:44,753
Ah!

131
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:49,230
You have walked all this distance
and you aren't tired to meet me, Lassie!

132
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,182
Lassie!

133
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:54,585
Oh?

134
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:57,540
Oh, sorry! Sorry!

135
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,356
I understand!

136
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:00,934
It comes to you in the after noon
every day at the three o'clock!

137
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,070
John Carraclough!

138
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:03,636
That's right, what's up?

139
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,090
No, I just heard about Lassie's story
from the Duke of Rudling.

140
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,225
It's so great!

141
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:12,971
- xxx
- You, can you look here?

142
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:13,744
Ah...

143
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,979
You have to smile again!

144
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,276
What's going on?

145
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,500
<i>It's great, isn't it?</i>

146
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,487
<i>It will be a very wonderful story!</i>

147
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:24,768
<i>"The boy who reopened the mine!"</i>

148
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:27,060
And the miracle dog who
traveled a long journey!

149
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:30,706
This is why we have to publish
this story in our newspaper!

150
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,261
I asked the Duke!

151
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,823
No, I can't believe it...

152
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:38,737
Well done, can I talk to you a bit more?

153
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:40,690
What do we do, Lassie?

154
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:43,347
<i>John!</i>

155
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:44,433
<i>John!</i>

156
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,698
What is it, Dad?

157
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:48,479
Have you seen the newspaper?

158
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:52,807
After work I bought it from
the Jones' store but...

159
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,479
I wonder where I put it?

160
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:58,948
Seriously, my father is weak...

161
00:09:59,003 --> 00:09:59,775
Hm?

162
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,040
Is it in this place?

163
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:01,782
Yes!

164
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:05,980
You lose the things you always love!

165
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,144
Hm?

166
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,636
What's up, John?

167
00:10:10,347 --> 00:10:11,089
Ah...

168
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,776
Father, in this newspaper...

169
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:15,440
I am there!

170
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:16,503
Eh?

171
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:17,995
<i>Look!</i>

172
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:19,854
<i>John and Lassie!</i>

173
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,057
<i>The dog Lassie ​​walked 600 miles to John,</i>

174
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:27,182
<i>after a long reunion.</i>

175
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:27,892
Eh?

176
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:28,893
Lassie...

177
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,979
You have become well known in England!

178
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,089
Oh?

179
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:52,651
Ah...?

180
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:07,183
Oh!

181
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,690
Is this from everyone to Lassie?

182
00:11:09,964 --> 00:11:10,721
Yes.

183
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:16,450
After the British newspaper article,
Lassie became very impressive!

184
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:19,152
I first receive

185
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,768
mail of this size at once...

186
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,628
I'm back!

187
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,588
- Eh?
- I?

188
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,900
Dad, you came back early today!

189
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:27,613
Oh...

190
00:11:27,714 --> 00:11:29,128
Ah, I'm tired...

191
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,770
No, I ran away.

192
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:33,003
Did you run away?

193
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,769
Yes.

194
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,548
I don't want another article to be written.

195
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:39,737
There are many journalists from
multiple companies coming to the mine.

196
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,130
You say Lassie?

197
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:44,240
I think the future of this dog is
different from the rest of the dogs!

198
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:47,640
Oh! Besides, didn't it do something similar?

199
00:11:47,753 --> 00:11:49,003
As I recall...

200
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:53,265
When Dr. Hooper fell in the abyss,
it told us to save him!

201
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,071
Ah, tell us more about that!

202
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:56,117
Hey Bill!

203
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:57,964
Don't evade work!

204
00:11:57,994 --> 00:12:00,041
I know that, boss...

205
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,783
Are you the manager?

206
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:04,619
- Uh...
- We want to talk to you for a moment!

207
00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:07,416
Ah... Damn...

208
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,705
Even in your clinic?

209
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,642
And even in the mine?

210
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:11,690
Yes...

211
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,890
I couldn't do anything to the patients.

212
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:17,674
I was caught on.

213
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,710
Dr. Hooper told me not to intrude
"Don't enter the clinic"!

214
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:23,050
Ah...

215
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,900
But what about John?

216
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:25,525
Ah!

217
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,893
He has gone with Priscilla and others to play!

218
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,034
And also Lassie!

219
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:29,949
Aha...

220
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,979
You see, John? It has become
a modern newspaper!

221
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,698
You've become famous, John!

222
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,026
I'm not, Lassie is!

223
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,909
But when we get to this area,
no one will reach us!

224
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,113
Yes!

225
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:45,003
Ah!

226
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,565
- Ah!
- Rock Castle!

227
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,589
As long as Lassie is in good health,
then we can go up together!

228
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:52,480
Yes!

229
00:12:59,356 --> 00:13:01,000
Hey, have you come here?

230
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:02,552
Mr. McNeill...!

231
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,890
Why are you here?

232
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,790
What? Actually I'm a journalist,
so finding this place is simple for me

233
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:14,090
In fact, I want to invite you,
John with Lassie to a party!

234
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:14,801
Eh?

235
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:16,231
- A party?
- A party?

236
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,340
<i>I understand!</i>

237
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,255
<i>This is your and your friends
secret rock castle!</i>

238
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,472
Can you climb to the top?

239
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:27,285
Well, can you see that?

240
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:28,753
I'll take your picture.

241
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:30,010
No, it doesn't matter!

242
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:31,520
I'm busy now!

243
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,263
Is that right? What is that?

244
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:36,210
It's people's messages to Lassie
after they read the newspaper.

245
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,926
Instead of Lassie, I will read it!

246
00:13:40,004 --> 00:13:40,737
Oh?

247
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:42,348
- Who who?
- Don't do it!

248
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:46,176
Isn't it audacious to read
the messages of others?

249
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,996
Y-yes! I apologise!

250
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,121
He is not our companion as well?

251
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:53,480
How long will he stay in such a place?

252
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:54,075
Hm...

253
00:13:54,104 --> 00:13:55,355
- Ah!
- What is the matter?

254
00:13:55,621 --> 00:13:57,066
T-t-this message!

255
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,199
Ah...! Wait a moment, Lassie!

256
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,785
I see!

257
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:02,840
You feel nostalgic, don't you?

258
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,598
What do you mean?

259
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:08,840
It''s a message from someone
who met Lassie on its journey!

260
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:09,730
- Eh?
- Eh?

261
00:14:10,738 --> 00:14:12,570
<i>To my dear Purcell</i>

262
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:16,129
<i>No, actually your name is Lassie, isn't it?</i>

263
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,488
<i>Dan went out to the village to sell the eggs.</i>

264
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,613
<i>He brought with him that newspaper.</i>

265
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,871
<i>As I expected, you returned after a long wait.</i>

266
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:28,262
<i>You also had a precious family!</i>

267
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,220
<i>We haven't mistaken to send you to them.</i>

268
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,920
<i>When you returned you were finally happy.</i>

269
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:38,966
<i>I am also very happy for you!</i>

270
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,334
<i>Greetings to your precious family!</i>

271
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,037
It's a wonderful message!

272
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:44,637
Yes!

273
00:14:44,662 --> 00:14:45,998
It's a nice message!

274
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:50,140
Lassie, you met many people on your trip!

275
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,068
One day I want to thank them with you!

276
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,473
How was it?

277
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:58,740
Isn't it happy that I wrote
about Lassie in the newspaper?

278
00:14:59,084 --> 00:15:00,388
Eh... Approximately...

279
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,730
If only the concert is held!

280
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,420
These... on what occasion?

281
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:06,013
Duke Rudling said

282
00:15:06,107 --> 00:15:09,138
he would organize a concert marking
the miraculous journey of Lassie,

283
00:15:09,163 --> 00:15:11,381
and it would be praised there!

284
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:14,870
Of course the villagers will be invited!

285
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:16,130
Grandfather?

286
00:15:16,326 --> 00:15:18,865
Also... can you call

287
00:15:19,107 --> 00:15:22,318
the old couple at the party?

288
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,412
What's your reply?

289
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,920
Of course you can attend the concert together!

290
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:33,373
Ah, as or the concert,

291
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:36,750
please keep it secret from
the rest of the journalists!

292
00:15:36,818 --> 00:15:38,513
Our library will work on exclusive coverage!

293
00:15:39,216 --> 00:15:43,980
In the end we couldn't climb the peak...

294
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,115
<i>Although Priscilla had trouble coming here...</i>

295
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:07,115
Ah! The preparation of the day
was strictly confidential!

296
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:09,904
This is thanks to John and Lassie!

297
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:10,945
No doubt about it!

298
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:14,185
Is everything ready, McNeil?

299
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,240
Yes, of course!

300
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:18,865
John and the miners are all here!

301
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:22,670
I'm sure the equipment

302
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,631
will appeal to you!

303
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,685
Well now I'll look at the equipment!

304
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:38,388
I'm the one who made the journalists do

305
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:40,443
all the hype!

306
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,967
Because of that I thought of myself only,

307
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:48,209
and put John and Lassie under
the pressure of many people!

308
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,240
How do I make him trust him?

309
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,380
Hey hey you have to come!

310
00:16:54,568 --> 00:16:57,396
How long will you work on our star for today?

311
00:16:57,545 --> 00:17:00,288
This child is not nice at all!

312
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:02,747
Should I wear these?

313
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,335
You, don't move!

314
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,585
What are you talking about?

315
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:10,179
Duke Rudling has invited many
people with high positions!

316
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,311
You will become an apprentice
if you appear on your nature, right?

317
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:17,257
Does my usual look really pathetic?

318
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,241
I didn't mean that!

319
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:23,430
You have a motive so strong that
the mine is not closed because of you!

320
00:17:23,538 --> 00:17:26,163
No adult can do what you do!

321
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:29,360
The Duke of Rudling admire you so much!

322
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:32,150
That is why we want to
show you in the finest form.

323
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:36,240
You have to think that this
will  make your future better!

324
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:37,280
Did you understand?

325
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,910
You will be treated in this
ceremony as an adult!

326
00:17:42,264 --> 00:17:46,110
<i>This clothes will not make you
jump and play in the fields!</i>

327
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:48,460
So I rely on you!

328
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:51,499
It will change your mindset when
it takes you a beautiful picture!

329
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:52,187
Bye...!

330
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,020
Oh! Sir McNeill!

331
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:54,935
Hm?

332
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,030
Do you still want something else?

333
00:17:56,163 --> 00:18:00,733
Excuse me, will Grandpa Dan
and Grandma and Dili really come?

334
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:02,436
Of course!

335
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,429
Today's concert will highlight the elderly
couple who helped to reunite Lassie!

336
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:10,062
Well, they seem to be a little late! See you!

337
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,952
Ah wait!

338
00:18:10,977 --> 00:18:11,601
Hm?

339
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,356
Sorry... What about Lassie?

340
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:14,644
Rest assured,

341
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:15,909
it will not go anywhere!

342
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:17,606
It is decorated in the next room!

343
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,794
Decorated?

344
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:20,051
You mean Lassie?

345
00:18:20,214 --> 00:18:23,324
The next is to brush off your hair!

346
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:23,919
Eh...!

347
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,544
Everything is going well!

348
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,390
Well, just wait!

349
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,280
These devices will add an amazing effect!

350
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:30,911
We have to pay attention to the guests now!

351
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:31,599
Yes!

352
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:33,676
Our sales this time will be better
because our material is full of tears!

353
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:34,318
Yes!

354
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:37,308
Oh, I'm glad to meet you!

355
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:41,420
I thought it was a good idea!

356
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:43,472
Here is the Duke!

357
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,630
All seem to have high positions!

358
00:18:45,762 --> 00:18:48,372
Everyone came because of what they
read about Lassie in the newspaper!

359
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:50,895
Everyone is excited about John's future!

360
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:51,864
Hm...

361
00:18:52,903 --> 00:18:55,083
Well you can wait here!

362
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:58,536
<i>It took a long time because of your ear!</i>

363
00:18:58,715 --> 00:18:59,880
<i>Isn't it nice?</i>

364
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,723
They seem to have started!

365
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,208
When your turn comes I will tell you,
wait here!

366
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,653
What is this face?

367
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:12,098
Ah, I don't like this shape!

368
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:16,137
We...

369
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,550
They exaggerated our form, don't you think so?

370
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,030
In some way, I feel that it is completely wrong.

371
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:30,420
I'm the only one who found coal,
and Lassie faced death on its way?

372
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,160
Yes, that is true!

373
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,100
And now...

374
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:43,606
The story of Lassie's long journey
was full of misfortunes and fatigue!

375
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:47,455
The basis of it was his separation from John

376
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:48,728
but John...

377
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:54,387
For Greenor Bridge he swore that coal
would come out with all the power he had!

378
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,125
He said: Lassie! Sorry I can't come
back to you, with tears in his eyes!

379
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,095
I'll take full responsibility!

380
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:05,463
John was very sure he would
extract coal for the village!

381
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:08,830
It was here that Lassie decided
to return to whatever the way!

382
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,390
Now let me introduce to you,

383
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:15,170
Miracle dog Lassie, and its owner John!

384
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:16,815
Eh?

385
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:17,885
Oh?

386
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,664
Oh?

387
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:21,775
What is happening?

388
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:23,174
They have not yet appeared.

389
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,310
What happened to John?

390
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,205
Actually this message...

391
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,275
Damn, they run away!

392
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,064
<i>Duke of Rudling,</i>

393
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,572
<i>I'm still unable to enter the world of adults.</i>

394
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,955
<i>I still want to run with Lassie</i>

395
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:46,979
<i>and the others in the fields!</i>

396
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,424
<i>That's it!</i>

397
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,930
I apologize to everyone, despite the fact
that they have struggled to come here,

398
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,563
John Carraclough...

399
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,580
<i>I'm Remy!</i>

400
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:02,867
<i>I sing!</i>

401
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,055
<i>No, I'm not alone!</i>

402
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:07,720
<i>Because I have a lot of nice friends!</i>

403
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:10,820
<i>But, where is my mother?</i>

404
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:12,785
<i>Mom!</i>

405
00:22:13,771 --> 00:22:16,291
<i>"HOMELESS GIRL REMY"
Please look forward!</i>
