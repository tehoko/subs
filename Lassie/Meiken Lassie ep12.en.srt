1
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,270
WHO CAUSED THE FIRE?

2
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,882
What's up, John?

3
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,970
Try harder!

4
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,357
Can't you be faster than Lassie?

5
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,021
Hey!

6
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:51,896
No way!

7
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:55,194
Ah... ah...

8
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,694
- Ah...!
- Ah...!

9
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,970
Lassie went too far...

10
00:02:28,712 --> 00:02:30,150
What's up, Duocho?

11
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,518
Oh?

12
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,002
Is it our guest while I sleep?

13
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,088
I...

14
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,205
Lassie!

15
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,697
Is this the big dog yours?

16
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,916
That's true, though.

17
00:02:43,142 --> 00:02:44,275
What about you Uncle?

18
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,979
The road was divided into four
directions, and while I was thinking

19
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,315
I was sleepy and I fall asleep.

20
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,970
Oh?

21
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,853
And now...

22
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,228
We have guests!

23
00:03:01,596 --> 00:03:02,572
Guests?

24
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,072
We are not guests!

25
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,512
That's too bad.

26
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,723
Isn't it, Duocho?

27
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,864
<i>Very bad!</i>

28
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,120
<i>Doucho is very sad,</i>

29
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,225
<i>his chest is almost bursting with pain!</i>

30
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:19,980
So one of you will come and ease his grief!

31
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:30,812
Oh...!

32
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,580
Just awesome!

33
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,272
Thanks!

34
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,421
This is my partner!

35
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:52,233
This is my partner.

36
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,038
His name is Pace! His specialty
is moving the vehicle.

37
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,639
I'm Rory!

38
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,600
By the way, do you know
a delicious bakery in the village?

39
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:03,483
Bakery? Maybe that is...

40
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,250
I know, Uncle Rice's bakery is the best!

41
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:06,890
Oh?

42
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,890
That's true!

43
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,320
He's helped by his daughter, Mary!

44
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:10,991
It's the best in the whole village!

45
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:12,327
Well I've decided!

46
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,235
I have a place to go today!

47
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:15,436
Isn't it, Duocho?

48
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,930
We have finally finished!

49
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:26,676
Well, let's go for a walk
and have a drink together!

50
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:33,310
Oh? Do you still deliver goods at this time?

51
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,616
<i>You work harder than we do!</i>

52
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:40,413
Eh?

53
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,061
John! Sandy!

54
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:51,460
And Lassie? What are they doing?

55
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,500
Lassie, isn't it amazing?

56
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,041
Can you do the same?

57
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,377
<i>And now, next...</i>

58
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:26,603
We need some help!

59
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,924
Let's see...

60
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:29,192
Okay!

61
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,427
This gentle miss, what do you think?

62
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,138
Yeah! Yeah!

63
00:05:34,231 --> 00:05:36,833
Would your husband be reluctant to look at you?

64
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,180
I'm rude!

65
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:42,458
<i>Stay there and hold this!</i>

66
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,098
So?

67
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,466
This is the best place!

68
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,790
Come on, Doucho!

69
00:05:56,527 --> 00:06:00,040
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
the great partner of the spotlight!

70
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:02,280
And this gentle miss,
I hope you applaud them!

71
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,810
And now, folks,

72
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,904
you have the honor to see some of my work!

73
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,920
We have utensils and all kinds of pans!

74
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,772
Let's go! Let's go!

75
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,740
Good! Good!

76
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,326
You're welcome, thank you for your purchase!

77
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,170
I want this one.

78
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,800
Rory is doing business and
is traveling around England!

79
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,680
Me too I wish I would go to many places!

80
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,255
Yes!

81
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,115
My God! My God! My God!

82
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,381
I would forget something important!

83
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,005
Please buy me bread to eat at dinner!

84
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,459
Okay! Lassie!

85
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,497
Let's go! To the bakery!

86
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:43,231
You are! You are!

87
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,347
How can you leave your job like that?

88
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:50,450
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

89
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:52,320
Today there is no bread because all were sold!

90
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,273
- Not even one?
- No!

91
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:57,734
I'll bake a new batch tomorrow morning...

92
00:06:57,882 --> 00:06:59,750
I understood, there is none.

93
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:01,234
Don't you have bread for tonight?

94
00:07:01,398 --> 00:07:02,133
No.

95
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,280
It's not for me, it is for Rory!

96
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,374
Rory?

97
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,970
Yes, that man who has a dog
which does amazing movements?

98
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:10,462
His voice is so loud that
I can hear him from here.

99
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:14,212
He came to this village because I told
him that we have a delicious bakery.

100
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:14,978
Is that right?

101
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:15,750
Mary!

102
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,150
We don't have anything to sell!

103
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,540
Let him go!

104
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,289
Yes, yes!

105
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,510
But will that man stay here tonight?

106
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,650
Mary!

107
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:26,721
Tomorrow morning I'll give you fresh bread!

108
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:27,300
Yes!

109
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:30,728
I see.

110
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,627
That's too bad.

111
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:36,885
Fresh bread makes the hearts of people happy.

112
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:39,518
Next to that beautiful girl!

113
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,080
Well, I will work tomorrow!

114
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:43,590
But what will you do?

115
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,300
You have no house here!

116
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,846
Nothing like that, I don't have
a house at all!

117
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:51,338
So, will you sleep in the stable?

118
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:53,385
No no, but I'm a vagabond!

119
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,041
Displacement is wonderful!

120
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,080
Under the stars of the sky that seem to fall!

121
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,088
Towards that sky to the large galaxies!

122
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,916
I sleep under it!

123
00:08:02,103 --> 00:08:03,280
Isn't it, Duocho?

124
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,440
Sky and stars...

125
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,345
<i>Look like they really fall down!</i>

126
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,213
Somehow this is scary...

127
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,096
Yes...

128
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:22,760
Have you traveled in many places?

129
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:23,838
Me?

130
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:26,130
Just, almost.

131
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,619
Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle,
and also Liverpool.

132
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:34,205
Eh...?

133
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:38,103
I only went to the simple villages.

134
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,009
My father was like me.

135
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,488
I was used to staying out at night
and homeless,

136
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:51,387
but there are many people who are bored
to stay between the walls of the house.

137
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:56,505
<i>Yet within this dimly lit window is a family.</i>

138
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,482
Thinking about it, this is warm and gentle.

139
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:05,349
It seems that staying in a home
is a lot more better than this.

140
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,890
But Uncle Rice is always angry
and screaming loudly!

141
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,715
It's no good!

142
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:14,515
You should not say that!

143
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,874
Right!

144
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:19,675
<i>Look!</i>

145
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:21,948
It's Sandy!

146
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:31,662
Can't you smell the delicious things?

147
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,220
Pace, it's delicious! It's the truth!

148
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,262
Oh really? Oh really?

149
00:09:44,465 --> 00:09:46,410
Oh really! Really really!

150
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:49,680
But there is a problem with
the handle of this pot.

151
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,194
<i>It can be used again after
it has been well repaired.</i>

152
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,350
It seems that Sandy's mother is interested
in keeping the dishes well!

153
00:09:57,436 --> 00:09:58,108
Eh?

154
00:09:58,179 --> 00:09:59,945
This pot is mine.

155
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,570
Eh?

156
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,021
I got it from my deceased grandmother
when I was a little girl.

157
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,716
That's why I cared about it well!

158
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,310
Is it you who made this tasty soup...

159
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:09,607
I did it!

160
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,951
Is that right? I apologize for my insolence!

161
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:15,969
Finally I knew! Isn't it, Duocho?

162
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,720
What now are natural people?

163
00:10:21,782 --> 00:10:23,985
Haven't you seen a falling star
or something like that?

164
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:25,197
Yes...

165
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:26,941
<i>Oh!</i>

166
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:28,666
It's a falling star!

167
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:30,850
Eh? Where? Where? Where?

168
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,230
Just gone...

169
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,394
I saw it too!

170
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,933
I really saw it! That is the devil... I am...

171
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:44,918
<i>Hm!</i>

172
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,155
They made a fire in such a place!

173
00:10:48,246 --> 00:10:50,895
What if a fire starts because of that? Damn!

174
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,930
Now, kids, have to go back!

175
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:54,624
Eh...?

176
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,037
Although we enjoy being with you...

177
00:10:56,483 --> 00:11:00,178
Don't you have mothers and
a warm home waiting for you?

178
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:02,900
Children have specific times
and can't go out at night.

179
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,311
You are not like me, homeless!

180
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,110
See you tomorrow!

181
00:11:07,256 --> 00:11:09,076
Did you have amazing
things for tomorrow?

182
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,233
Doucho wants to make this happen
with greater success!

183
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,420
- Bye!
- Good night!

184
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:16,921
Bye!

185
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,802
<i>Lassie, let's go!</i>

186
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:25,333
That boy owns a huge dog,
beautiful shape, Doucho.

187
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:26,990
It was good!

188
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,580
I have finished, Doucho.

189
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:49,898
Should I sleep now?

190
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,916
That's bad!

191
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,740
Fire!

192
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,532
Damn!

193
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:57,376
It's a fire!

194
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,197
Hey! It's a fire!

195
00:12:59,354 --> 00:13:01,004
Wake up!

196
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:05,726
Oh? A fire started?

197
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,850
It's near my house!

198
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:08,991
Oh!

199
00:13:09,264 --> 00:13:11,764
Water! Water! Curse it!

200
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,428
Give it to me!

201
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,053
It's bad!

202
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:34,969
Yes!

203
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:37,830
Sandy!

204
00:13:37,978 --> 00:13:39,853
I came to deliver the milk!

205
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:41,298
Hello, good morning!

206
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,410
What? Have you brought milk?

207
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:45,210
Unfortunately,

208
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,134
it's not from my house!

209
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:51,035
Listen, Mr. Rory needs milk with
the bread at breakfast, right?

210
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,240
Ah, that 's right!

211
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:56,652
Lassie, do you want to meet Dousho as well?

212
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,846
Who came this early morning?

213
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:02,698
- Colin?
- Uh...!

214
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:03,970
John! Something bad happened!

215
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:07,135
Rory! Rory has troubles!

216
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,440
- Eh?
- What happened?

217
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,034
- Oh?
- Oh?

218
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,360
How many times should I tell you that?

219
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,040
I certainly turned off the fire before I slept!

220
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:29,345
So how it burned, huh?

221
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,994
Well, Mr Rice...

222
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,690
This man worked hard to extinguish the fire.

223
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,800
What is important is that the fire
didn't reached the nearby houses.

224
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,770
What will you do if we can't control the fire?

225
00:14:39,908 --> 00:14:43,086
I also asked for help without any charge!

226
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:45,290
Don't think you will leave safely
after you have caused the fire!

227
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:47,088
What will you do?

228
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:48,730
Father!

229
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,838
Dad, you always do this!

230
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,220
You are very interested in your customers
to buy bread from our home!

231
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,696
This guy is...

232
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:56,860
Don't joke with me!

233
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,924
I bake bread for the villagers only!

234
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:03,270
I don't sell to men of this kind!

235
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:05,051
Father!

236
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:06,053
Isn't it?

237
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:09,483
I don't know anything about bread,
but it was hard to extinguish the fire!

238
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,950
This means

239
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:14,217
I must preserve my life and
the life of the people of my village.

240
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,362
It is better to leave our village immediately!

241
00:15:17,807 --> 00:15:19,096
Do you have an objection?

242
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,760
I'll tell you again.

243
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,276
I didn't set fire!

244
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:27,030
No, no doubt it's you!

245
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:30,892
I understand.  I don't like
to say this again though.

246
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:32,010
Scum...

247
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,257
I know that, you don't have to tell me that.

248
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,390
You see? Definitely the reason!

249
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,012
I want to say only one thing.

250
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,965
I sell bowls and dishes.

251
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:53,455
I travel to make people smile through
the acrobatic games that Doucho loves.

252
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:54,635
Bye!

253
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,190
Rory!

254
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,932
Are you leaving?

255
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:03,260
I have no other chioce.

256
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,236
But...

257
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,471
Don't say "but" again!

258
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:08,838
Thank you for the food!

259
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:10,752
The food was delicious, miss!

260
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,760
It's fixed!

261
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,533
Well, the store owner wants me
to leave, so the village be protected.

262
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,723
We'll meet again!

263
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,613
Rory... left...

264
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:41,199
I don't know if the lamp
or wood caused th fire.

265
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:43,942
It was close to my house and
it almost burned because of it.

266
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:45,140
Father!

267
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,285
A lamp?

268
00:16:46,817 --> 00:16:47,832
Or wood?

269
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:48,684
Uh?

270
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,470
Hey Colin!

271
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,370
To the worst, John!

272
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,746
Should I hit the door only?

273
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,801
John, what to do?

274
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:01,621
What?

275
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,762
You say what?  But Mr. Rice is scary

276
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:06,254
What?

277
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:08,028
Mr Rice, I'm sorry...

278
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,625
What? I must bake the bread late today
with the oven already cooled!

279
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,988
I'll go to bake again!

280
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,005
Quick! He's gone!

281
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:18,934
Sorry, Mr Rice!

282
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,253
What? I'm busy!

283
00:17:21,278 --> 00:17:22,949
Not me, but Colin...

284
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:26,113
Excuse me... this, sorry...

285
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,190
So I said, what?

286
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,660
John, tell him...

287
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:33,036
Eh...?

288
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:35,685
Eh?

289
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,207
Is this the truth?

290
00:17:37,232 --> 00:17:37,942
Yes!

291
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:40,427
<i>What do you say?</i>

292
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,832
The lamp and firewood were
extinguished at 11 o'clock!

293
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:44,481
Yes...

294
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,285
Eh...?

295
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,957
This means that Colin woke up
and looked at the window.

296
00:17:48,982 --> 00:17:51,473
How come a child stays up until late at night?

297
00:17:51,498 --> 00:17:52,153
Uh...

298
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,934
I was trying to see the meteors...

299
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,231
That's why...

300
00:17:56,387 --> 00:17:57,926
Falling stars, you say?

301
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,684
If you talk loudly you will scare the children!

302
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:01,856
Uh...

303
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,270
Anyway, Mr. Rory turned off the lamp.

304
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,184
And extinguished the fire with water.

305
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,215
Isn't it?

306
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:09,981
Yes.

307
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,059
This means that wasn't the cause of the fire.

308
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,036
Hmm...

309
00:18:14,587 --> 00:18:18,197
If the cause of the fire is different
from that, then...

310
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,693
Enough, just hurry up!

311
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,110
Can't you go faster?

312
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,146
I'm deaf, you're distracted in driving!

313
00:18:44,342 --> 00:18:45,146
But...

314
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,754
What do I say to that man?

315
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:49,256
You must apologize to him!

316
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:52,856
I thought about the safety of the village.

317
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:54,590
If I say so...

318
00:18:54,715 --> 00:18:58,184
No matter what you say,
it's your fault anyway!

319
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,551
I was very impressed by Rory's presence.

320
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:03,559
Yes.

321
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,379
I hope he stays in our village
and doesn't go anywhere else.

322
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:08,090
That's too bad.

323
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,340
I want to talk more with Mr. Rory.

324
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,262
Don't make this sad face, Duocho!

325
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,441
There are times when people should laugh at it!

326
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,801
Hey, aren't you a dog?

327
00:19:50,225 --> 00:19:52,465
What's up, Pace? Why have you stopped?

328
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:56,420
Hey, get out of the way quickly!

329
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:58,478
The ship will come soon!

330
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:08,626
Here it is! It's Rory!

331
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:10,432
<i>Oh! But...</i>

332
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:14,350
Rory will cross the bridge!

333
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,967
Damn, the engine hangs now...

334
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,370
Rory!

335
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:23,990
Wait, John!

336
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,193
You too, Dad! Run after the children!

337
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:35,115
Hey Pace!

338
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,866
I want to cross this bridge.

339
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,859
In the next village
we will see beautiful things.

340
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,173
Hey come on, Pace!

341
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,422
Lassie?

342
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,859
What are you doing here?

343
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:01,258
Oh Doucho!

344
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:05,680
What?

345
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,578
Rory, don't cross this bridge!

346
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:10,492
My father, it's my father's fault!

347
00:21:10,735 --> 00:21:12,219
<i>Hey!</i>

348
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,281
Don't go on that road!

349
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,583
I see.

350
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,630
This is because of these kids.

351
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:39,352
This means we will do
fun things there, right?

352
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:44,690
Yeah! Yeah!

353
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,986
<i>Sandy's poor cow was stolen.</i>

354
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,548
<i>We must find the perpetrator,</i>

355
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,036
<i>so everyone decided to look for him.</i>

356
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:09,563
<i>Sandy behaves strangely!</i>

357
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,146
<i>Next episode:
SANDY STEALS COWS?</i>

358
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,040
<i>Be sure to watch!</i>
