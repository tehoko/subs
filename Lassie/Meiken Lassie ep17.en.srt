00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,110
THE MARRIAGE OF TEACHER CURRY

2
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:36,741
He's coming!

3
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,530
Congratulations, teacher!

4
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,624
Congratulations, teacher!

5
00:01:50,085 --> 00:01:50,827
Oh?

6
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,280
Tomorrow is the day of your wedding,
I hope you don't get upset, teacher!

7
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,770
I wish you a happy life!

8
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:03,136
- Oh...!
- Oh...!

9
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:05,293
The blackboard is for study only!

10
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,520
Don't spoil it with anything else!

11
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:09,370
What have you done?

12
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,622
Let's get started!

13
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,325
Let's start the lesson immediately!

14
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,301
<i>When you see the sun at
the beginning of the summer,</i>

15
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:19,723
the sky looks beautiful and very warm.

16
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,012
The wind comes in the fifth month,

17
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:23,833
<i>and then the buds are fertilized</i>

18
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,606
<i>and so it is every summer...</i>

19
00:02:28,955 --> 00:02:31,405
Lassie... Well, that 's enough!

20
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,289
We'll gave her this bouqet!

21
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:35,442
The bride will be very happy!

22
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,710
I wish I could see teacher Curry
with a happy face!

23
00:02:38,777 --> 00:02:41,129
Anyway, we'll celebrate it soon!

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,309
This is the teacher's face!

25
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,220
It wouldn't be bad that
teacher Curry suddenly smiles!

26
00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:48,668
That's what I think too!

27
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,695
She'll be happy for this!

28
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:54,910
Thank you!

29
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:57,597
I want it delivered to Miss Mary directly!

30
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:59,152
I also want to congratulate her!

31
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,150
Ah, right now she went out with Curry!

32
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:04,566
Went for a consultation about the new home!

33
00:03:04,863 --> 00:03:07,299
Well, I can give it to her myself!

34
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:08,320
No, no!

35
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:10,660
We will take it to the residence
of the teacher Curry!

36
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:12,199
Then we'll give it to Miss Mary!

37
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,644
What makes you laugh?

38
00:03:15,684 --> 00:03:16,457
Eh?

39
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,197
But we are going to Mr. Curry and Miss Mary!

40
00:03:21,222 --> 00:03:22,228
I know!

41
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:23,580
The teacher will be there!

42
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,074
I wonder how his face looks when
he talks to her on their own?

43
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:26,689
Oh?

44
00:03:26,714 --> 00:03:27,527
<i>Let's go!</i>

45
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:40,070
We will go to the church!

46
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,066
Right.

47
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:45,854
Is that all?

48
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,034
What?

49
00:03:47,222 --> 00:03:47,949
Hm?

50
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,972
What is the matter?

51
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:56,386
Have you forgotten anything else important?

52
00:03:57,214 --> 00:03:58,861
Something else important?

53
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:00,714
Yes, something else is very important!

54
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,589
Well...

55
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:05,659
The wedding settings are ready.

56
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,950
Honeymoon equipment is arranged.

57
00:04:08,065 --> 00:04:09,181
I don't mean this.

58
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:11,170
You didn't mean that...

59
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:14,143
That's right!

60
00:04:14,268 --> 00:04:15,964
I forgot one thing!

61
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,140
Have you noticed that?

62
00:04:17,244 --> 00:04:18,767
It's the wedding ring!

63
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:19,644
Hm...

64
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,104
So I won't forget it...

65
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:26,600
I have to keep it in my wedding
coat pocket for tomorrow!

66
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,628
Everything is complete now!

67
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:31,040
<i>Oh really? Oh really?</i>

68
00:04:31,097 --> 00:04:31,698
Huh?

69
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:34,698
Isn't there something else you have forgotten?

70
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,549
Another thing...

71
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,479
It's the most important!

72
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,878
You haven't yet done it.

73
00:04:41,183 --> 00:04:41,831
Huh?

74
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:45,964
I can't marry you!

75
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:46,839
Eh?

76
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,720
The situation seems strange...

77
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,479
What absurdity are you talking about?

78
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,010
It's not ridiculous!

79
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,385
If you don't have any idea...

80
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,596
Well, that's it.

81
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:06,651
There will be no wedding, be prepared.

82
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,846
You seem to be nervous
just before the wedding!

83
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,495
Come home and sleep well!

84
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,081
Now, I will take you!

85
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:18,175
I will be fine!

86
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,604
I can go back alone!

87
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:20,440
See you!

88
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:22,268
Well, be careful!

89
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,206
I'm serious.

90
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,331
Well okay, I understand!

91
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:32,620
We'll talk about this thing
again after the wedding!

92
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,182
<i>Miss Mary!</i>

93
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,300
Hm?

94
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,128
It's you!

95
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,329
Oh!

96
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:03,534
It smells beautiful!

97
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,839
Thank you!

98
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,143
- Listen, Miss Mary...
- Hm?

99
00:06:07,362 --> 00:06:10,565
There won't be a wedding tomorrow.

100
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:12,150
Is it a lie?

101
00:06:13,065 --> 00:06:14,501
I don't know...

102
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:16,719
Maybe it was a lie.

103
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:19,329
But... why?

104
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,784
What happened?

105
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:22,032
Could be...

106
00:06:22,142 --> 00:06:25,501
Could it be that you
don't like Curry teacher?

107
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:28,407
I love him...

108
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:31,704
This is the problem.

109
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,431
Teacher Curry is already poor.

110
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:39,165
It's true that he is shy and very nervous.

111
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:42,039
I don't think he's a nice person at all!

112
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:44,075
John, don't say this to Miss Mary!

113
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,086
But...

114
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:49,370
John, it is true that he is shy.

115
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:52,767
But in the end he is a straight
person and always smiling!

116
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,267
He is also a very honest person with himself.

117
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:02,048
After reading his favorite poem
I can see his beautiful smile.

118
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:03,501
But why?

119
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:06,352
Really, why?

120
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:07,759
Sorry!

121
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:10,748
I can't say this thing to you.

122
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:12,095
Listen, Miss Mary!

123
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:14,907
You don't abstain, you can talk to us.

124
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:15,605
Yes.

125
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,940
What happened?

126
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,747
I am also good at listening to others.

127
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:24,404
Well...

128
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:27,669
In fact...

129
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,833
<i>Father, listen!</i>

130
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:39,748
Hm?

131
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,872
Sorry...

132
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,154
What is the matter?

133
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,560
What is it?

134
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,326
Sorry Dad...

135
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,786
Do you like mother?

136
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:51,834
Oh...?

137
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,763
Why do you suddenly ask?

138
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,083
What did you answer?

139
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:57,904
Of course, I love your mother!

140
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,060
You too.

141
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:03,044
<i>Can you tell this to my mother directly?</i>

142
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,529
<i>Of course!</i>

143
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:08,615
<i>W-why did you suddenly ask?</i>

144
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,470
<i>Don't matter.</i>

145
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,460
<i>Hey John!</i>

146
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,443
<i>It's a secret!</i>

147
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:19,334
Oh...

148
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:22,000
Dear, it's a beautiful morning!

149
00:08:22,122 --> 00:08:23,622
Wake up and get ready!

150
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,849
Oh...

151
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,430
What is the matter?

152
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,080
<i>It's the wedding!</i>

153
00:08:28,756 --> 00:08:29,521
Uh...

154
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:31,919
It's Curry's wedding today.

155
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,380
It's the best time for a wedding.

156
00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:35,651
Oh...

157
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:36,582
<i>John!</i>

158
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:38,458
John, wake up!

159
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,919
What? Where did he go?

160
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,466
<i>Also Lassie?</i>

161
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,340
Mary...

162
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:17,747
What? Robert!

163
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:18,503
Oh...!

164
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:20,130
As expected from you, you came early!

165
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,860
Yeah...

166
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,646
What about Mary?

167
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:23,911
Isn't she in the waiting room?

168
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,153
Haven't you seen her yet?

169
00:09:26,662 --> 00:09:27,341
Eh...

170
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,990
No, not yet.

171
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,645
Before the wedding,

172
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:34,849
it's not good to see her before she dresses!

173
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,005
Of course, I don't believe in superstitions!

174
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,021
<i>But it wasn't in the waiting room!</i>

175
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,138
She may still be asleep!

176
00:09:43,427 --> 00:09:46,449
She's fine, I'm sure she's still in her room!

177
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:47,357
<i>Yes!</i>

178
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,443
<i>See you later!</i>

179
00:09:52,784 --> 00:09:54,143
She hasn't come yet...

180
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:56,175
Oh...

181
00:10:03,356 --> 00:10:05,705
<i>I wonder what should I write?</i>

182
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,229
To Robert!

183
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:09,143
To Robert...

184
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,143
Then...

185
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,690
<i>It's 10 o'clock!</i>

186
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:15,112
<i>30 minutes left til the wedding!</i>

187
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,284
Yes.

188
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,440
Somehow I feel that you helped me a lot!

189
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,800
xxx

190
00:10:25,604 --> 00:10:27,580
Congratulations, teacher Curry!

191
00:10:27,682 --> 00:10:29,245
Thank you so much!

192
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,720
I'm jealous of you!

193
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,932
No way...

194
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,448
Mary is late...

195
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:36,534
Mary? Hasn't she come yet?

196
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:37,347
No.

197
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,320
<i>Strange!</i>

198
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,420
<i>She should be wearing her dress now...</i>

199
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,659
Oh...?

200
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,049
Sorry, excuse me for a moment!

201
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,854
Where's Mary?

202
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,056
Mary?

203
00:10:49,493 --> 00:10:52,595
Mary has long gone before me.

204
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,380
What is the matter?

205
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,649
It's...

206
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,798
Congratulations!

207
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,250
Congratulations!

208
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,290
Thanks!

209
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,641
Why didn't Mary come?

210
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,665
She wanted to hear my answer!

211
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,524
What happened with Mary?

212
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:17,244
Yes.

213
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,570
<i>I can't marry you!</i>

214
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,430
<i>I'm serious.</i>

215
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,578
What happened?

216
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,540
Yes.

217
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:30,000
Congratulations, I'm happy for you!

218
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,563
How is the father feeling now?

219
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:34,797
Come come!

220
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:37,590
Huh...

221
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:48,777
Hm?

222
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,706
You're John Carraclough's dog, right?

223
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,456
You can't enter the church.

224
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:55,535
<i>Hm?</i>

225
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,503
Just a moment, give me this!

226
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,206
To Robert Curry

227
00:12:00,534 --> 00:12:02,104
Could this be...

228
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:02,926
Oh?

229
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,995
Mary!

230
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,902
It's a message from Mary!

231
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,574
It's a message from Mary!

232
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:19,105
What is it?

233
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,800
Well good!

234
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:23,570
Open the envelope quickly
and read the message!

235
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:26,402
What are you going to do?

236
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,886
Robert!

237
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:30,722
Oh! Father! Mother!

238
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:33,019
You finally came!

239
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,457
Ah...!

240
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:37,636
The message is more important...!

241
00:12:38,363 --> 00:12:40,324
It's my child's wedding!

242
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:43,940
Even from the other side
of the earth you can fly.

243
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:46,300
Where is your nice fiancée?

244
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:48,058
I want to see it quickly!

245
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,230
That's what I mean...

246
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,550
No, she went to bring something
she had just forgotten!

247
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:55,558
Is it a wedding dress?

248
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:57,410
So it should take longer.

249
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,270
This is a calamity!

250
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,980
<i>Read it quickly!</i>

251
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,630
I apologize for the late submission of myself...

252
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,027
I'm Mary's father!

253
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,652
Well...

254
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,910
Right, the message!

255
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,494
Congratulations, teacher!

256
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:11,612
Congratulations!

257
00:13:11,652 --> 00:13:13,663
Ah... Thank you so much!

258
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,105
Where is your bride?

259
00:13:15,222 --> 00:13:16,540
Is it okay to meet her?

260
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,564
Now... she went to bring something
she has forgotten...

261
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:21,277
Read the message!

262
00:13:22,863 --> 00:13:23,980
What shall we do?

263
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,745
The priest will come soon.

264
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
What to do, Dad?

265
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:30,826
I'm not your father yet!

266
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,341
I apologise!

267
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,560
Heck, if I knew that, I wouldn't have
thought of being a husband to her!

268
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,052
This... I can't believe it!

269
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,716
Congratulations, Mr Rice! Teacher Curry!

270
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:43,575
No way!

271
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,185
He seems to have completely
forgotten the message!

272
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,888
The guests must've arrived by now...

273
00:13:52,974 --> 00:13:55,568
I''m sure that teacher Curry
will come, and he is scared!

274
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,709
Would you do this good work?

275
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,650
Never doubt about it!

276
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,904
Will marriage be so good?

277
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,959
This is true.

278
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,146
You don't have to say that.

279
00:14:32,982 --> 00:14:34,690
What happened with Mary?

280
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,873
Why didn't she come?

281
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:39,373
Yesterday we had no problem!

282
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:46,224
Mary...

283
00:14:46,397 --> 00:14:48,623
Where are you now?

284
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:50,240
Oh...

285
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,120
What are you doing?

286
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:54,709
Oh?

287
00:14:57,341 --> 00:14:59,584
I know, the letter!

288
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,591
Well done! Read it quickly!

289
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,037
<i>I will wait for you in the place
of our first memories.</i>

290
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,248
Mary...

291
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,055
Oh...

292
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,570
<i>Mary!</i>

293
00:15:19,203 --> 00:15:20,242
We go also!

294
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:20,969
Yes!

295
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,742
Mary! Mary! Mary!

296
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:27,711
Ah! Ouch!

297
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:30,359
Mary...!

298
00:15:31,704 --> 00:15:32,446
Mary!

299
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:35,165
Mary!

300
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,069
Yes, teacher!

301
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:38,539
To the memory of xxx to your face!

302
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:41,188
<i>But...</i>

303
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,914
Not this way!

304
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,477
School is not on this side!

305
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,060
Teacher Curry went on the wrong path!

306
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't go that way!

307
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:51,008
Mary!

308
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:53,352
<i>Mary!</i>

309
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:54,980
Miss Mary wrote the place
where their memories!

310
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,370
I thought he would know
that right away, but...

311
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,450
He never knew!

312
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,710
Curly teacher is running fast...

313
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,620
Lassie, I have to hurry!

314
00:16:08,806 --> 00:16:10,445
I don't have time to play with you...!

315
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,165
Ah...!

316
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:14,688
<i>Ah...!</i>

317
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,094
<i>Hey!</i>

318
00:16:16,164 --> 00:16:18,125
This thing is a precious marriage ring!

319
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,289
<i>Hey wait!</i>

320
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,882
Well done, Lassie!

321
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,366
<i>Please wait!</i>

322
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,109
Why did she come to such a place?

323
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,210
Lassie, stop!

324
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:57,106
<i>Mary...</i>

325
00:16:58,575 --> 00:16:59,560
I understand!

326
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:01,864
I have something else I forgot to say to you!

327
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:03,564
Oh really?

328
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:06,033
Yeah, it's about wallpaper!

329
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,658
As I said, I also like the green color!

330
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:09,970
Wallpaper?

331
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:11,408
Oh...

332
00:17:11,502 --> 00:17:12,978
Am I wrong?

333
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,110
So what about?

334
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,556
I will always make sure not to bother you!

335
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,244
Not to bother me?

336
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,861
I will fix the flaws all my life!

337
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:23,142
I'll sort my clothes well!

338
00:17:23,244 --> 00:17:25,806
I will be sure to brush
my teeth after eating meals!

339
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,247
<i>I'll be very careful not to eat messy!</i>

340
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:31,057
<i>Also clean the place after cutting my nails...</i>

341
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,427
He act like children!

342
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:33,942
So Mary...

343
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:35,792
Don't be angry with me and marry me!

344
00:17:35,817 --> 00:17:37,060
Wait a moment!

345
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:37,826
Eh...?

346
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,888
I'm not angry on these things!

347
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,911
So, what is it?

348
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,732
In this place we had the first
conversation between us, right?

349
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,778
When I came to deliver the school trip bread...

350
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,185
This is true!

351
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,857
As long as you said this is true...

352
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,051
Have you remembered the memories
that we have come to here?

353
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,723
No, actually I went to Berry Forest near by.

354
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,941
After that, Lassie took my box...

355
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,809
Yes, the box!

356
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:12,887
Hey, give me the box, Lassie!

357
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:16,379
Robert...

358
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,176
Sorry...

359
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,816
Have you forgotten the most important
thing you should say?

360
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:24,879
I-it's true...

361
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:28,838
I thought that you would talk about the same
subject that took place yesterday.

362
00:18:28,863 --> 00:18:30,080
Not just yesterday!

363
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:32,144
I wonder how many times have
I tried to ask you about it?

364
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:34,973
Is that right...

365
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:40,610
The thing I forgot, that I forgot...

366
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:42,465
Well...

367
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:45,566
Why do you want to marry me?

368
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:49,910
Of course you are nice and good at cooking!

369
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:51,600
You are also interested in books

370
00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:52,916
and also the wallpaper's color...

371
00:18:52,941 --> 00:18:55,535
I didn't want to say this to me!

372
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:56,723
Well...

373
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,676
I mean...

374
00:18:59,277 --> 00:19:01,369
Marriage between men and women means...

375
00:19:01,394 --> 00:19:05,387
In other words, the beginning
of the establishment of the family!

376
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:06,964
<i>Other than that...</i>

377
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:13,206
Tell me again...

378
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:16,698
Why do you want to marry me?

379
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:18,714
Oh!

380
00:19:21,322 --> 00:19:22,642
This...

381
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:23,363
Yes...

382
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,620
This is because you are a professional player!

383
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,917
Your white fingers are clicking on the piano,
and then the melody comes out beautifully!

384
00:19:30,987 --> 00:19:32,503
And then my ears...

385
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:34,792
It's a sign of the size of our relationship!

386
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:37,784
There is a word I wanted to hear from you!

387
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,175
I don't care!

388
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:42,448
But there is what I want of your heart
before it comes out of your mouth!

389
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,511
I want you to tell me with all your energy!

390
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:48,112
I love you.

391
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,066
What have you just said?

392
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:53,058
I love you!

393
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,441
<i>I can't hear you!</i>

394
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:56,523
I love you, Mary!

395
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:58,308
That's why I want to marry you!

396
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:09,340
Finally you managed to tell me.

397
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,574
You never told me that.

398
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,855
I don't believe it!

399
00:20:15,449 --> 00:20:16,183
Oh...

400
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:18,042
So it seems...

401
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:19,066
This is true.

402
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,003
Yes, Lassie!

403
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,105
Enough now!

404
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,917
Lassie...

405
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:26,277
Come!

406
00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:27,902
Come with me!

407
00:20:28,098 --> 00:20:28,816
Yes.

408
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,285
I love you, Robert!

409
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:33,105
I accept your marriage!

410
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,144
Oh!

411
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:35,658
Congratulations, teacher!

412
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,189
Eh?

413
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:37,850
Congratulations, I wish you a happy life!

414
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,675
Congratulations!

415
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,199
Eh?

416
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:44,206
You, what?

417
00:20:45,605 --> 00:20:46,308
Eh!

418
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:47,308
Uh!

419
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:48,183
A-ah!

420
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,500
Sir, don't neglect your clothes!

421
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:53,378
Make sure you brush your teeth well!

422
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:56,150
We didn't notice these things to you!

423
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,675
Yes! Yes!

424
00:20:58,706 --> 00:20:59,964
Oh, dear ones!

425
00:21:24,777 --> 00:21:26,681
Mary, throw the bouquet!

426
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:27,670
Over here! Over here!

427
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,675
Who picks up the bouquet
will be the next bride!

428
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:31,932
Okay!

429
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,490
Lassie!

430
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,182
<i>There is a circus in the village!</i>

431
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:05,823
<i>They have a huge elephant.</i>

432
00:22:05,995 --> 00:22:08,932
<i>It is very afraid of the whip.</i>

433
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:09,954
<i>And...</i>

434
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,587
<i>Next episode:</i>

435
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,320
<i>A BIG PROBLEM! THE ELEPHANT
ESCAPED FROM THE CIRCUS</i>

436
00:22:14,462 --> 00:22:15,775
<i>Be sure to watch!</i>
