1
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,837
The manager has lost his golden watch!

2
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:27,118
That man you brought is the real thief!

3
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,146
That man?

4
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,959
It's Ian! The thief!

5
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,529
No, don't tell to the people!

6
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,865
<i>However I will inevitably catch him!</i>

7
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,390
DETECTING THE INNOCENCE OF IAN!

8
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:06,290
Ian is amazing!

9
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,165
It seems so.

10
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:11,954
To the degree the birds come
and they are reassuring to Ian.

11
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,380
On his shoulders and on his head...

12
00:02:14,436 --> 00:02:15,576
- Eh...?!
- Eh...?!

13
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,177
How many birds?

14
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,982
How many birds...?
In any case it were many!

15
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,950
That's why we ask about the number of birds?

16
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,224
Maybe six... maybe not, five!

17
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,050
What? This number is not great!

18
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,575
Well, maybe it is.

19
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:37,849
But this is not what I meant!

20
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:42,357
I mean the birds are flying around
Ian and it is reassuring!

21
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:43,716
It's like...

22
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,036
I know!

23
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,536
I know! The trees!

24
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,255
At that time Ian seemed as big as trees!

25
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,810
<i>But is not that man a thief?</i>

26
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:56,802
I heard from my father that
he had stolen from the bank!

27
00:02:57,388 --> 00:02:58,138
Oh...

28
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,700
This time he stole a golden watch.

29
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,855
My father and mother told me...

30
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:06,960
...he's very dangerous and
I shouldn't approach him!

31
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,059
Scotland Yard came here too to catch him!

32
00:03:11,913 --> 00:03:13,082
B-but...

33
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,824
<i>When I met Ian, I felt that</i>

34
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:22,161
<i>that person was terrifying.</i>

35
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:24,949
<i>It's painful to misunderstand him!</i>

36
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,871
He can't be!

37
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:31,402
<i>I don't think Ian is a bad person!</i>

38
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,684
I also don't think he is a bad person!

39
00:03:35,043 --> 00:03:36,090
Sandy!

40
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,250
As John said,

41
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:40,434
birds and animals can tell!

42
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:43,941
It knows who is a good person,
and who is a bad person!

43
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:46,434
<i>Can't be fooled by only the forms of people!</i>

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,527
<i>Animals can't be fooled at all!</i>

45
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:49,652
- Oh...?
- Oh...?

46
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:51,925
Are you telling the truth?

47
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:53,348
It's the truth!

48
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:55,738
Every serious thing is always true!

49
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,823
<i>But...</i>

50
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:59,253
Birds don't understand anything.

51
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:00,166
Isn't it?

52
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:00,941
That's true!

53
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:02,136
Yes...

54
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,208
It doesn't seem that Ian is a bad man!

55
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,638
People can't be judged by their appearances!

56
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,114
Listen, Ian!

57
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,263
Ian, you're not a bank robber, right?

58
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:51,105
I trust you.

59
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:52,115
But...

60
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:55,661
If you remain silent, Ian,
the others won't understand you!

61
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,091
If they were wrong, you said to them,
"You are wrong"!

62
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,317
If you explained them directly, Ian,

63
00:05:02,473 --> 00:05:04,323
I'm sure everyone will understand that!

64
00:05:08,512 --> 00:05:09,207
Yes.

65
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:12,168
But I'm working now.

66
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,410
Ian...

67
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:39,941
Ian...

68
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:43,003
Why don't you explain it to others?

69
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,636
Wait wait!

70
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:47,519
Has a big problem?

71
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,293
Good morning.

72
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,800
Ah, good morning!

73
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:01,964
Breakfast will be ready soon!

74
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:06,996
Sorry but... Can you deliver lunch to your
father in the mine on your way to school?

75
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:08,136
Yes.

76
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:10,816
It's okay, but why two?

77
00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:12,824
One for your father.

78
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:14,910
And the other for Ian.

79
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:16,550
Uh! Ian?

80
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,199
But why Ian doesn't explain it to others?

81
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,430
John.

82
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:32,425
John, do you think Ian will relax
when he tells to the others?

83
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:36,933
It's true that he doesn't speak
much with others.

84
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,957
But if he doesn't speak,
he won't be believed by the others.

85
00:06:46,877 --> 00:06:48,198
Listen, John...

86
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:49,332
Yes?

87
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,699
Your father told me.

88
00:06:52,003 --> 00:06:54,675
Ian continued to work hard and didn't left,

89
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:57,590
in spite of the rumors spread about him.

90
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,824
That's why he's not worried about that.

91
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:02,066
Ah...

92
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:04,402
I think so too.

93
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:06,520
Yes.

94
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,597
That's right, this is what you
think isn't your memory?

95
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,074
I understood, Mom!

96
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,160
I rely on you, John!

97
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,780
Yes!

98
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,961
Good morning!

99
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,148
Hello, good morning, John! Be careful!

100
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,172
Hello, what's up?

101
00:07:41,665 --> 00:07:42,215
Yes.

102
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,330
Your meal!

103
00:07:43,602 --> 00:07:44,844
Ah, thank you!

104
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:45,610
Oh?

105
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:48,789
And the other... is it for Ian?

106
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:49,633
Yes!

107
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:51,594
Mother made it for him!

108
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:52,797
I see.

109
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,718
Father!

110
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,570
Hm?

111
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,417
Make everyone understand Ian!

112
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:00,613
Oh?

113
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,430
Do your best, Dad! See you!

114
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:05,245
Oh!

115
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,949
Ian!

116
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,582
Ian, are you here?

117
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,692
You went to the forest again?

118
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,340
Ah...

119
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,715
Whoa...

120
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:44,606
Whoa!

121
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:53,317
I see!

122
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:54,731
The knife is for making these!

123
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,692
Oh?

124
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:08,152
It's not Ian...

125
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,500
Lassie!

126
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,434
Lassie!

127
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:35,207
Who was that person a little while ago?

128
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,480
A button...

129
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:54,885
Well, put it here!

130
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:57,180
I apologize...

131
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,838
...to leave you in a place like this!

132
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:00,893
It's nothing...

133
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,314
We can process the things you want slowly.

134
00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:07,424
These must be designed...

135
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:11,474
Oh...

136
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,841
This is...

137
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,815
Ian!

138
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,995
This is...

139
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,770
Ian Cooper!

140
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,370
28 years old, from Yorkshire!

141
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,623
Right now, we'll search your room!

142
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,636
The gold watch of the manager
Duhan of Wellington Mine was stolen!

143
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,215
Oh?

144
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:35,378
Whose is this clock?

145
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:36,464
No...

146
00:10:36,597 --> 00:10:37,621
Are you?

147
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,925
No, you're wrong!

148
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,292
So who?

149
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,410
I don't know.

150
00:10:41,526 --> 00:10:42,784
I found it here.

151
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,276
You found it here?

152
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,010
In this man's room...?

153
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,961
Maybe the clock is stolen!

154
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,800
But that is Ian...

155
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,830
Walter... continue from manager Duhan!

156
00:10:57,127 --> 00:10:58,814
We will investigate this guide!

157
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:00,127
Yes!

158
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,100
<i>The next king was James I.</i>

159
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,350
<i>James was the father of Mary Stuart.</i>

160
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:16,967
<i>When Queen Elizabeth died,</i>

161
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:19,474
<i>there was no successor then.</i>

162
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:22,990
<i>According to the descendants of the
King of England, the King of Stewart...</i>

163
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:25,380
Oh, this is! This is!

164
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,521
Look!

165
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,536
<i>It has my initials here!</i>

166
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:32,950
It's a souvenir from my grandfather, who died.

167
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,478
It's very precious to me!

168
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,650
Thank you for your cooperation, Manager!

169
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,110
Who did that?

170
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,532
What are you talking about?

171
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,290
Yesterday evening you got
some very aggressive advice

172
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,837
from Mr. Carraclough, didn't you?

173
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,337
You seem to have found the directory instead.

174
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,079
You did a good job!

175
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,560
We will take the rest of the
purposes here to investigate!

176
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,806
We may find another evidence against him.

177
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:07,001
For example, he participated
in the bank robbery!

178
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,267
Walter, take it with you!

179
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,640
Hey stop it! Stay away!

180
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,046
Stop it!

181
00:12:28,324 --> 00:12:29,616
Stop it, Lassie!

182
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:31,062
It's a dangerous dog.

183
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,804
It's wise to let such a dog free?

184
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:35,945
Lassie!

185
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,523
What is the matter?
It wasn't like that before!

186
00:12:41,523 --> 00:12:42,296
Lassie!

187
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:45,304
One of you... one of you bring a strand!

188
00:12:53,178 --> 00:12:56,022
<i>What? Lassie's not here...</i>

189
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,660
Hasn't Lassie come yet?

190
00:13:11,787 --> 00:13:14,475
It's not its habit not to come with John.

191
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:16,670
I wonder if something happened?

192
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:17,811
I don't know...

193
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,748
He always asked me in my house!

194
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,709
What do they talk about?

195
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:29,153
If it's true...

196
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:30,940
I don't think so!

197
00:13:30,965 --> 00:13:32,708
Dad, the latest thing?

198
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:33,905
No, that...

199
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,178
The police arrested Ian.

200
00:13:37,257 --> 00:13:38,202
- Eh?
- Eh?

201
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,881
Well, go!

202
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,264
Get in the car!

203
00:13:58,483 --> 00:13:59,350
Why?

204
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:02,264
Is not clear? You are detained!

205
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,694
When we get to the main office
you can recognize.

206
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,550
Not just the watch, but your other actions!

207
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:10,639
Why was the watch inside my room?

208
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:11,826
Hm!

209
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:13,700
This is what you stole!

210
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,420
Ian!

211
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,725
You seem to know the truth, Mr. Carraclough!

212
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:21,037
This means...

213
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:22,200
<i>Ian!</i>

214
00:14:23,774 --> 00:14:24,446
Oh!

215
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,297
Don't approach this dangerous man, boy!

216
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,977
Maybe you do something bad!

217
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,164
I'm not a criminal.

218
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:35,328
Ian!

219
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,469
You seem to have become close
to a great liar, Mr. Carraclough.

220
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:43,740
I understand your feelings!

221
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,664
<i>See you!</i>

222
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,038
And now go in! Go in immediately!

223
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:54,125
Dad, do something!

224
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:58,359
I found the clock in Ian's room.

225
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,328
I remembered, when Ian was outside his room...!

226
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:02,524
Eh...

227
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,000
I found this button in his room
when someone entered it!

228
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:07,758
Hm?

229
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,320
Bring him in quickly!

230
00:15:09,414 --> 00:15:10,039
Yes!

231
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,703
Don't try to resist!

232
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:16,766
John, have you entered his room
without his permission?

233
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,650
Sorry, Dad...

234
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,656
I know it's wrong but...

235
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:23,018
But the most important thing
is what happened next!

236
00:15:23,111 --> 00:15:25,490
What are you doing? Do it immediately!

237
00:15:25,588 --> 00:15:29,963
John, you mean that this button belongs
to the person who entered the room?

238
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,377
Yes! Probably!

239
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:34,361
John, give me the button
to let Lassie to smell it!

240
00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:35,299
Yes!

241
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:40,624
What is the matter?

242
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,307
Haven't you moved yet?

243
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:43,127
A-ha!

244
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,970
Lassie, look now for the button holder!

245
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,420
Please wait until we check more Ian's arrest!

246
00:15:52,478 --> 00:15:53,920
- The arrest for the golden watch!
- Let's go!

247
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,995
But...

248
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,689
Don't worry about it, just go!

249
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,712
Hey, wait!

250
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,930
Lassie!

251
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,103
Wonderful, this is good!

252
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,447
The police of England will close
the search file for the offender

253
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,837
because the real criminal is in our hands!

254
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:12,714
We did something great!

255
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:13,416
Yes.

256
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,041
That dog...

257
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:28,854
Let him go down!

258
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,416
Okay, but...

259
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:39,909
Lassie!

260
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,299
Oh, that's bad!

261
00:16:45,845 --> 00:16:47,040
It's the same coat!

262
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:48,995
Look, it's the same button!

263
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,550
Yes!

264
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,100
What are you doing with my luggage?

265
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:53,470
Leave her alone!

266
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,901
I'm sure you did something!

267
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:58,901
No...

268
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:01,299
You try to harass me again?

269
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,518
If you use force, you will be transferred
to the public administration

270
00:17:04,543 --> 00:17:07,190
to receive your punishment, Mr. Carraclough!

271
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,916
I'm sure you don't want to wear
the aggressor's clothes in front of your son.

272
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,721
I don't want that, of course!

273
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:15,878
Hmm...

274
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,182
To what purpose?

275
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:22,549
At that time... The person who entered
Ian's room is you, you hysterical, right?

276
00:17:22,713 --> 00:17:26,041
Mr. Dohan's golden watch has been
placed by you in Ian's room!

277
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:27,237
Hm?

278
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:34,173
And what else?

279
00:17:34,198 --> 00:17:36,737
I was under the bed!

280
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:37,595
Oh...

281
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,110
Have you seen my face?

282
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:41,610
I didn't see you, though...!

283
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,432
No! No!

284
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,073
Mr. Carraclough!

285
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,784
How did you teach your son?

286
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:53,541
Who does accuse others
of criminality without evidence,

287
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,239
is you, Mr. Carraclough! Isn't it?

288
00:17:57,334 --> 00:17:57,951
Oh?

289
00:17:58,318 --> 00:17:59,286
But...

290
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,380
<i>Oh, I mean, this issue is different?</i>

291
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,825
There is even an evidence!

292
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:06,458
It's the same button that was in Ian's room!

293
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:07,842
Hm!

294
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,875
It may have fallen from me
when I investigated him earlier.

295
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,997
This means that you have no evidence!

296
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:15,177
Ian is the golden clock thief!

297
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:16,262
<i>Detective!</i>

298
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,044
<i>Stop it!</i>

299
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,302
It's enough!

300
00:18:22,943 --> 00:18:27,239
I also thought it wasn't right
that we should seize him like this!

301
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,224
Walter, what are you saying?

302
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,146
Ian is doomed to steal the bank originally!

303
00:18:34,576 --> 00:18:36,029
Even if it is a criminal case,

304
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:40,779
Ian hasn't committed any crime!

305
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:43,488
Eh? Is this the truth?

306
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:46,489
<i>I also thought he was the real thief!</i>

307
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:47,560
What?

308
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:50,881
Also that bank robbery

309
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:54,160
is suspected of being done by a gang!

310
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,872
Silent, Walter!

311
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,958
No, I won't shut up!

312
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:00,896
Ian didn't steal the golden watch!

313
00:19:01,177 --> 00:19:02,342
- Eh...?
- Oh?

314
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:06,725
I found the clock in the office drawer
of manager Duhan!

315
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:10,435
You infiltrated into Ian's room
and putting it there!

316
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:11,396
Uh uh...

317
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,080
I understood, if that's what happened.

318
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:15,974
Yes.

319
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:29,912
Hm... hm!

320
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:34,318
Come on, Walter!

321
00:19:34,365 --> 00:19:35,029
Oh...

322
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,044
Go back to the head office!

323
00:19:38,326 --> 00:19:38,943
Yes!

324
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,693
Ian Cooper!

325
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:43,910
I still think you were at the bank!

326
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:45,396
I won't give up!

327
00:19:45,614 --> 00:19:46,980
Get the cuffs off of him!

328
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:47,818
Yes!

329
00:19:52,128 --> 00:19:53,122
I apologise.

330
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:54,248
Yes.

331
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,113
What are you doing, Walter?

332
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:57,365
Go back in the car!

333
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,318
Don't make me lose my temper
more, you villain!

334
00:20:00,486 --> 00:20:02,256
Okay! I'm coming!

335
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,250
Lassie, well done!

336
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:16,100
Thanks to you!

337
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,685
<i>The band of the bank robbers was caught!</i>

338
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,735
That's great!

339
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,841
This story explains!

340
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:32,630
This is the story of Ian's innocence.

341
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,357
Eh?

342
00:20:34,153 --> 00:20:35,643
No, but this is bad!

343
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,888
Because of me, Ian was
accused without being guilty!

344
00:20:40,154 --> 00:20:43,280
Is not it better to keep him doing his work?

345
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,458
For this...

346
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,629
I have told you from the start
that Ian can't be the bank robber!

347
00:20:50,654 --> 00:20:52,037
I trusted him!

348
00:20:52,115 --> 00:20:55,500
You really are a good man!

349
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,643
Wait, I want to see him too!

350
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:25,213
Whoa...

351
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,830
<i>When Dr. Hooper went to catch
fish, he was seriously injured!</i>

352
00:22:02,142 --> 00:22:05,244
<i>I tried to save him, but I couldn't!</i>

353
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:09,541
<i>Lassie, you are the only one
who can tell to the villagers!</i>

354
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:13,572
<i>Next episode:
HURRY! SAVE DR. HOOPER</i>

355
00:22:13,786 --> 00:22:14,996
<i>Be sure to watch!</i>
